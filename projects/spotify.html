                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>Over the course of fall 2020 and onwards, the team and I designed and developed a user-facing website to discover new music with the people close to oneself. We believe that sharing music with others brings people closer, and
                                by combining people's music taste with their friends, they both can discover new music, together. </p>
                            <p style="margin-top: -40px"><b style="color: #d0d0d0">Update:</b> We have currently reached to <s>over 28 countries</s> <b style="color: #d0d0d0">over 68 countries</b>! As well, <s>over 700+ playlists</s> <b style="color: #d0d0d0">over 1400+ playlists</b>                                have been created so far :) (as of 18/2/21)</p>
                            <h2>Role</h2>
                            <p>Working with a team of six, my responsibilities entailed designing and developing an accessible and aesthetic design that can correspond on a mobile device, as well as desktop. I focused on the task flow between pages, making
                                sure the front-end matched with the design, and creating a unique aesthetic that's visually pleasing and welcoming to new and returning users.
                            </p>
                            <h2>The problem</h2>
                            <p>Music exploration has been aided by Spotify's Discover Weekly playlists and other recommendation playlists, but these are typically listened to <b style="color: #d0d0d0">alone</b>. There is a <b style="color: #d0d0d0">lack of experience with discovering
                                music with others</b>, and Spotify did try that with their Listen Alike concept, where you can compare your music taste to famous artists and podcasters. But we wanted to define an experience for the user and whoever that
                                user chooses, and encourage them to find hidden gems socially.</p>

                        <p>When I joined the Discover Together team, the project was already conceptualized by Arjun and Trustin, where the backend capabilities were functional. The website lacked the visual appeal, which is where they brought on myself
                            and Ann Li to revamp the design.

                            unique link and their top 50 songs. </p>

                            which caused some confusion when first landing onto the platform.

                            its own love language). By partnering with dating organizations, the rate of successful matches can increase as people explore their potential match's music taste.

                        <h2>What I learned</h2>
                        <p>Reflecting upon the time that passed as I worked on Discover Together with the team, it was a great opportunity for me to work closely between development and design as we begin to officially roll out the platform. Gathering feedback
                            and implementing that was easier to do with a small team because it was more immediate to address the people involved for that, and the business aspect of marketing and partnerships showed me the more holistic approach towards
                            understanding the later stages of a product.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-40px">As I move forward with my design experience, I helped define the identity of a product, and what the metrics for success would be for us as we grow our audience and user base. By emphasizing accessibility and ease of use for users,
                            it taught me more about growing a product from the start, and how to further expand my skillset through polishing user flows and the micro-interactions involved.</p>

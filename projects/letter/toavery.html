                <h1>It hasn't even been that long since we broke it off but the days blur together. 
                    The black birds were chirping so loud that Friday but the silence between me and you 
                    drowned it out. Your building blocked the light, but the sun rays kissed the city 
                    landscape as the blue skies stretched beyond. It was a beautiful, warm day and it 
                    seemed to mock us for being surrounded by four, grey walls, talking about things 
                    that contrasted the vibrance outside. </h1>
                
                <h1>It's like I almost heard you say “stay”. Your eyes were teary with streaks staining 
                    your rosy cheeks. Your bottom lip quivered as you puffed up your face, trying to 
                    hold yourself back from a breakdown. It was so hard to even look at you in the eyes, 
                    but I wanted to burn your face into my memory. </h1>

                <h1>“Life will keep going on,” you said. But all I heard were the same words I've heard 
                    before. The same words that I've cried over before. </h1>

                <h1>It's coming up on the 18th month mark, and it feels as though I lost a piece of my 
                    heart. I never wished for this to play out the way it did, and I'm sure you didn't 
                    either. The memories of our “last's” replay in my head - the last time you slept in 
                    my bed, the last time I saw you smile, the last time I said "I love you". Your door 
                    closing felt like a metaphor that you've closed that door for us, and I heard 
                    it loud and clear like the black birds.</h1>

                <h1>There was a piece of writing that you never saw called "And suddenly all the songs 
                    were about you". I never finished it, but I'll leave it to your imagination, 
                    because I hope everything I did for you was my physical manifestation of my love 
                    for you. But I guess we didn't showcase it enough of that in a way that it would've 
                    resonated with either of us. </h1>

                <h1>All this effort just to go back to acting like strangers again. But I hope you know 
                    that to me, we are never off the table. I love you, always.</h1>

                <h4>A love letter to a future version of me</h4>

                <h1>The snow is slowly melting outside as it steadily creeps closer to 2022, and I'm 
                    sitting at home wearing my red, oversized, arts sweater. The evening is dark and cold, 
                    with the hazy shadows of the night's sky casting a somber light indoors. It's December 30, 
                    2021, and it feels like I've been living this year with my eyes wide shut; how is it already 
                    the end of the year? </h1>
                <h1>So I write this to myself, a year from now, to take a look back on me at the start of this year 
                    to where I am right now.</h1>

                <h1>---</h1>

                <h1>Dear me of 2022,</h1>
                <h1>As 2021 leaves me, the bitter taste of retrograde remains in my mouth. Reflecting on 
                    everything that's occurred in my life this year, there's so much to say, yet the words 
                    escape me still. I'd like to think that I did everything right, and that my instincts 
                    brought me to a happier state of mind - but that is simply untrue. My interactions and 
                    experiences with myself and others were riddled with mistakes and misgivings, but that doesn't 
                    and shouldn't define me. It's how I rectify them and move forward.</h1>

                <h2>Things that happened, a recap</h2>
                <h3 class="override-top-m">Career/Design</h3>
                <h1>A lot of things happened this year, and what I'm about to list out are merely the ones I 
                    can currently remember, though there is probably much more that evade my train of thought. 
                    Starting the year off in terms of work and design, the project about Discover Together was 
                    finally wrapped up with the Aphrodite Project partnering up with us. </h1>
                <h1>As well, I applied to 300 jobs within the span of January to April - applications, LinkedIn 
                    messages, cold emails... there were the highs of hearing from Google and Twitch, and the lows 
                    of Pencil and Tulip bullshit. I was too egotistical, thinking that with Watsi and Synqrinus, 
                    I was ahead of the bunch. And to be far, I guess I was, but that did cause me to become conceited 
                    in what I wanted. I ended up doing interviews and design challenges for Lacework, Panasonic, and 
                    CDK Global during exam season at the end of April. Rejection, rejection, job, respectively. Finally 
                    got CDK Global at the end of April, and it started in June so I had 6 weeks to recover and regain 
                    my composure. </h1>
                <h1>That was the most burnt out I've been in ages, and that was a carried over continuation from the 
                    end of 2020 with my mental low of the breakup with Norah. Past that, I had high hopes for Loo Labs, 
                    but once Aman and Queenie left, Jeff decided to make uncanny decisions that left me out in the sun to 
                    dry. Him and Carolina fucked me over, and I do not plan on revisiting those memories here, but Olya 
                    and myself bonded over our mutual anger of the fallout there (which by the way, I should reach out 
                    to her again, it's been a while). </h1>
                <h1>But know that things did pick up after the fact, with Formlabs initially ghosting me in January, 
                    only to give me the job in May. I deferred the offer to January 2022, and that gave me so much peace 
                    of mind this fall term. There was no need for me to look for a job while everyone else was stressed 
                    with balancing 2B and interviews, but I'm thriving in that aspect. Boston will be a great change of 
                    pace for me mentally, and I'm excited to see what comes out of it. Only concerns right now are COVID 
                    to board my plane, and the high levels of infection there, but that's a later issue that hopefully 
                    will work itself out.</h1>
                <h1>Besides the coop hustle, I got the opportunity to volunteer at Watsi. It was an on and off thing, but 
                    was a good step towards what I can potentially see myself thriving to do in the future. Synqrinus also 
                    reached out with a little more work, but I finally cut the rope and they no longer are my freelancing 
                    connection. The money was great, but I'm happier with that load off my shoulders. As well, many 
                    other startups have been reaching out to me, asking me to join them as lead designers, and that 
                    excites me. Not because I can work with them, but because there is already a foundation for my name 
                    being known and my skills being wanted. My ego is happy, but there is still a long road ahead of me.</h1>
            
                <h3>Personal life/trips</h3>
                <h1>Sam, Raewyn, Chidi, and I were gonna go to Vancouver for the summer term to work remotely. But the flair 
                    of the Brazilian variant scared Raewyn, and she bailed. Understandable, but still uncanny when she still 
                    moves to Toronto anyways. We (well really I) dealt with an extremely unhappy landlord, and we lost $400 
                    each to the security deposit.</h1>
                <h1>So instead, I decided to go to Vancouver at the end of the summer term anyways because fuck COVID, I'm 
                    tryna at least live a lil and see Keaton and Andy. I visited two days before the end of the CDK term in 
                    Surrey with Keaton, then went over to Vancouver with Andy after a few days. The weather was beautiful, 
                    and I felt blessed. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>Besides that, Sam and I spontaneously decided to go to NYC during reading week. Absolutely no regrets; the 
                    trip was incredible, we did so much and drank practically every day. Met Zarwan, met Jaimie; ate good food, 
                    drank good drinks. The influence I've had on Sam has made her more spontaneous and social, and it's great 
                    seeing her be happy. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>With those trips, the second half of the fall term, I've been a little more frugal with money. Had a talk 
                    with Sam, and we both agreed that it's not necessarily because we are broke, but because you can always earn 
                    back money, but you can't get back experiences. Truly no regrets.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>The start of the year was with her living rent free in my head, and still to this day. It's draining, emotionally 
                    saddening, and sometimes I wish things could've worked out differently. But it happens the way it does, and I 
                    can't regret that. I've learnt a lot this year, where I've gotten to a more introspective state of mind. I noticed 
                    everyone puts too much emphasis in the words people say as the basis for their character from that person's 
                    perspective, rather than the smaller actions that portray them much better than the words of someone unaware 
                    or still learning about themselves. Read through the previous journal posts to see my growth, experiences, and 
                    thoughts.</h1>
                <h1>Besides all this, I've dated around. Notable ones were Sarah, where she progressively became more and more 
                    two-dimensional. It was a situationship/friends 
                    with benefits. Pity and loneliness was the motivator there, and I hope the best for her, just without me. I also met 
                    Jaimie in NYC, and we vibed well. We had a one night stand, but I realized how empty that makes me feel, and how 
                    I become more emotionally attached. I require the emotion to drive a relationship and sex, so that taught me 
                    something at least. Meeting and chatting with so many others, my friends and I realized that I pull, which is 
                    cool for my ego, but nothing ever panned out. I met Lucy, who ended up telling me I was soft and had no red flags, 
                    so she wasn't attracted. What the fuck is that about? I don't know. I was on the verge of just shutting it down and 
                    picking it up in Boston to at least make friends, but right before that, I met Avery. We just clicked, looking for 
                    the same thing at the same time. Right person, right time? It sure feels that way; things are still fresh, so we'll 
                    see how things go from here. Don't be hasty, me. Don't let my past mistakes repeat with Avery, please.</h1>
                
                <h3>Personal life/etc</h3>
                <h1>With everything above, there was much more that happened. Failed my G test once due to a stupid, minor thing, 
                    but finally passed the second time after worrying my license would expire before I come back from Boston. 
                    Same, Keaton, Olya, and I also worked on the Poster Project, and things were optimistic but eventually died 
                    out. Good concept, but lacked motivation and drive. I also had a loose screw in my jaw from the surgery, so 
                    I went through a rough time removing that. That also includes the infected ear at the end of fall term, and 
                    hives at the beginning of the year. So lots of medical fuckups to my body. Alongside all this, I finally decided 
                    to try out therapy. It wasn't too particularly helpful, but it 
                    helped consolidate my thoughts on certain things (check out my draft on the sessions). So much more that I 
                    probably forgot about, but this is the general jist.</h1>

                <h2>List of close friends that i hold close to heart this year</h2>
                <h1>Sam - we're as close as ever. Of course there was a few hiccups here and there, but it's notable that we both 
                    value our friendship together and don't want anything to get in the way of that. NYC was wonderful, we have 
                    very similar boundaries and thought processes, same standards with school. She opened up about how she's 
                    gonna be pretty sad while I'm gone, but I trust that she'll be alright and that she'll be in good company 
                    with Keaton and the twins. </h1>
                <h1>Keaton - after seeing him again since end of 2019 in Surrey, he's a close friend of mine. Still slightly naive 
                    and young, but he'll grow. Sam and I talked about this and how I leave a strong influence on people, and I 
                    suppose that's true. He values what me and Sam think, though probably not academically (lol). That's okay, 
                    I'm excited to see how he'll prosper, but first, he needs to be less cringe and more open minded.</h1>
                <h1>Andy - it's like time never really passed. Seeing him again in Van, we were bros just like before he left. 
                    He's in his prime, with a great environment to thrive, and I hope he learns to be more warm. He may be empathetic, 
                    but he still has ways to go when it comes to being less self-centred. We facetime often to update each other on 
                    life, but it does sometimes feel like he isn't too interested in what I have to say with my life. Jordan is giving 
                    him perspective on the tech industry, which is amazing, but I worry what he's causing to Andy's mental state 
                    after the cheating incident. </h1>
                <h1>Laura - same old, same old. We don't talk constantly, but we do love to catch up every so often, and that 
                    is what works for us. She's adjusting to Ryerson, but I believe in her. Manifesting good energy for her, 
                    she'll do just fine. We've always had the same thoughts for some things, but I really appreciate her perspective 
                    when it comes to some of my problems and things I do. It's really grounding, what she does for me.</h1>
                <h1>Raewyn - crazy ass mofo, and I fucking love that for her. Middle of 2B, we said fuck school, let's have a 5 
                    hour discussion on life and our personal lives. We found out that despite having such different upbringings, 
                    we have such a scarily similar thought process and opinion on life, people, and other things. At the end of 
                    the term, she told me that she's her most truest and most comfortable version of herself with me, and I 
                    really treasured that. You're a really lit ass fucker, and I value our friendship. #homies4life, but seriously 
                    tho, where the podcast at?</h1>
                
                <h2>Reflections on this year and my learnings on self, life, and moving forward</h2>
                <h1>The first thing I want to tell you is that time doesn't fully heal wounds. At least, not for me. I feel 
                    that I am forever in motion with the past, and Laura always tells me that same thing. That I'm too hung up 
                    on things that already passed. I am forced by my program to constantly think about the future, and I'm 
                    trying to live in the moment when I can, but I psychologically get too caught up in the past. </h1>
                <h1 class="spacing-b">But that's okay. 2021 me is working through things, and I hope the me that's reading this a year from now 
                    is thriving. Currently in love w/ philosophy, psychology, cinematography, drawing, blogging, poetry, 
                    volleyball, board games, music production, sneakers, and so much more. I made 4 new playlists each month that describes 
                    my moods during that time. I wrote numerous journal posts that explore a more vulnerable and introspective version of myself - 
                    meant for myself but left public for anyone that cares to read it. Boston -> Waterloo -> where next 
                    for my 5th coop (hopefully NYC, SF, or Norway). There are trips lined up for next year, where the end of 
                    Formlabs is when Sam and (hopefully twins + others) come visit me in Boston/NYC for a lit ass time before 
                    in-person 3A rips us a new one. Middle/end of August, family wants to go on a cruise in Alaska, and staying 
                    in Vancouver for a few days afterwards. Who knows where else I'll be in 2022, but I hope you know that every 
                    little thing will be okay, Lam. Things always work out, one way or another. </h1>

                <h4>New beginnings</h4>

                <h1>Begin each year with the end in mind. That's what I'm telling myself right now, and I hope that a year 
                    today will be exactly how I hope it to be. </h1>
                <h1>But let's recap 2020. Moved out and lived in Toronto with Laura, Andrew, and Anna. Had a great time 
                    working at BlueCat and ending the shift hanging out with Sam, or heading to a restaurant with Rae,
                    or going to the gym and cooking. I learned HTML/CSS and coded my website, which got me great positions.
                    I was feeling great, being social and productive, living life. I still rode that vibe going into the 
                    pandemic, which was when I met Norah. 6 months; 1 month of falling in love, 5 months of being in love, 
                    and the end of 2020 with sadness and heartbreak. Breakups are much easier to deal with when you're not 
                    couped up at home 24/7. My saving grace was Sam, Keaton, Laura, Andy. Through the depression and mental 
                    booms caused by 1B and Norah, I need to grow as a person still. Don't we all?</h1>
                <h1>Though Norah did take up most of my year, I learned how to deepen my friendships and slowly learn to love 
                    myself. I had the cheating scandal with 112, and that was horrible but that's now past me. Had the surgery, 
                    and though it wasn't exactly how I envisioned it to be, it's over now and I can move forward. Worked on 
                    Communifund, a side project about deepening community bonds. Let's list out what I did:</h1>
                <h1>· UWPM</h1>
                <h1>· Enlight</h1>
                <h1>· Loo Labs</h1>

                <h1>· new ideas!</h1>
                <h1>-> and much more that I don't remember. This is when I was at my lowest and super unmotivated, so imagine 
                    what'll happen when I'm at my highest.</h1>

                <h1>Started 2020 in Niagara Falls with Andy and Jacob, this time I'm gonna start with Laura and Debbie. 2021's 
                    gonna be hype - podcast launch, new portfolio, new coop, summer in Vancouver/Montreal/? with Rae, DT x 
                    Aphrodite and maybe Bumble + others, maybe even befriending Norah again or/and finding new love.</h1>

                <h1 class="spacing-b">This year's for me. Losing sight of what's important means my eyes are open. This is my time, 2021.</h1>

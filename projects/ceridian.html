                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>During my internship at Ceridian, I worked as a mobile product designer to address feature enhancements and drive accessibility for in production features. The calendar feature had only a monthly view, which was used for employee
                                shift details, payroll, and other features. There were accessibility concerns raised about the monthly view, and they needed to be addressed based on how users would go about the calendar.</p>
                            <h2>Role</h2>
                            <p>One of the three designers working on Dayforce while owning and driving the research of the problem space related to the accessibility concerns and the future direction. Working alongside a product owner, business analyst,
                                design team, and developers that understand the calendar code, I collected and presented my research to the product owner, with next steps to be interviewing company employees.
                            </p>
                            <h2>The problem</h2>
                            <p>With the current state of the Dayforce calendar, the monthly view provided shift details that causes a variety of issues for users. One issue was that by having a monthly view, users that have issues related to vision will
                                struggle to read and understand calendar content. Alongside that, <b>Talk Back/Voice Over accessibility features provided by IOS and Android phones could not properly read the content.</b></p>

                        <h2>Context</h2>
                        <p>The calendar feature was one of the first features implemented on Dayforce, which means that as more recent features are developed, the calendar needs to be redesigned to reflect the modern features rolled out. One of the new features,
                            Timesheets, provides users with a weekly view of the month for their payroll. The calendar feature needs a toggle to which between monthly view and list view, and though Timesheets has one implemented, it outlines dates where
                            nothing is listed. This will add clutter as the Voice Over/Talk Back features would read the unnecessary data.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-40px">By doing an analysis of different calendars on established apps, I was able to illustrate themes and patterns associated with each calendar that the Dayforce calendar can benefit from. Based on that, I made recommendations for
                            what direction the Dayforce calendar should go. Handing it off onto the rest of the design team, they will conduct user interviews with company employees to see their task flows and pain points with the current calendar. </p>

                        <h2>Reflections</h2>
                        <p>During my time at Ceridian, I’ve grown to understand the central role of meeting escalating demands by users, applications, and services. It challenged me to take part in addressing real-life issues and topics from a unique, yet
                            creative lense, and I learned more about the research stage as I dived into the workforce management industry. Though my strength lies in user interfaces and visualizations, I developed my perspective to back up my decisions
                            with structured product reasoning more than ever before.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -40px">To wrap things up, <b>I designed interfaces based on user requirements and workflows, addressed accessibility concerns throughout various features, and collaborated with product, development, and design teams to discuss consistency throughout the Dayforce app as I designed and iterated through outdated interfaces.</b>                            Moving forward, I want to strengthen my research skills and train myself to emphasize deeper with target audiences as I explore different points of view.</p>

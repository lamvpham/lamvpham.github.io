                        <h2>Role</h2>
                        <p>With my internship at CDK Global, I spent summer 2021 as a UX Design intern on the Radial Design Systems (RDS) team. 
                            The project I worked on for 8 weeks of the internship is about the <b>UX architecture of a new notification center, and how the designed 
                            prototype reflects the requirements and functionalities that product teams need</b>.</p>

                        <h2>The problem</h2>
                        <p class="problem-statement">How might we help reduce the lack of consistency across all CDK platforms/apps and address the product team's 
                            needs for a standardized notification center? </p>
                    
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>The final designed prototypes have uniformity with modern product architecture patterns and accessibility for a wider 
                            audience of users. The generalized designs provided flexibility to match the requirements needed from the design 
                            systems team and product teams.</p>

                            The project quickly became too complex, resulting in its abandonment due to scope creep and lack of clarity for its

                            level for any CDK product. I would need to establish <b>foundational requirements on global notification patterns</b>

                        <p>The initial approach to understanding and laying out the architecture and interactions of a notification center 
                            was to do a competitive analysis on other established design systems. Researching the notification aspects of 
                            GitHub Primer and Uber Base design systems helped understand other approaches to a notification center.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-40px;">I had to look back to the initial circumstances for the task two years prior, where the progression of the first 
                            notification center was surrounded by a multitude of questions and nonstandardized UX patterns using custom 
                            components. The line between notification, messaging, and task list was very blurred:</p>

                            dealerships and their customers. Chatting with the design manager showcased the current 
                            components and patterns that are being used on that product. With this, I could replicate those interaction 
                            patterns and information hierarchy onto the notification center containing the messaging hub for global 
                            consistency between products.</p>

                            notification center: the first one using a dialog window for the center, the second being a full page, and the third being a mix

                            These higher fidelity dialog window designs portrayed two options for switching between alerts and messages only.</p>

                            dialog window space with only one click. As well, adding a footer to indicate going to the full page

                            for users are limited to viewing notifications/messages, going into a conversation and sending a message, and going 
                            to the full page notification center.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-40px">Viewing from the full page center, there are deep links when viewing notifications that 
                            navigate out towards the page with that content. This interaction allows for users to stay productive and get more 
                            context on what the information displayed in the notification is about, making the notifications actionable.</p>

                        <p>Testing protocols to validate the architecture patterns of the designs were through usability verification from the RDS 
                            team. The designs had the accessible standards of WCAG 2.0 and a11y, and also integrated well with the components already 
                            developed; meaning less complexity for developer handoff.</p>
                      
                        <h2>Tradeoffs being done with the design</h2>
                        <p>Due to the generalized aspect of the notification center, the specific use cases of other CDK products may not be easily 
                            integratable. The components from the hi-fi prototypes were designed and fleshed out to be accessible for a variety of 
                            situations, but the high-level functionality of the components are limited to the newly established requirements.</p>

                        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                        <p>Future iterations can build upon and guide current designers on how to tackle notifications. The foundational designs 
                            are finalized and future designers from other teams can use the notification components in the UI Kit. Future plans 
                            for Text Connect align similarly with the approach for this notification center, and will benefit the product’s progress 
                            by cutting design/development costs.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusions and what I learned</h2>
                        <p>The adoption of the UI Kit components and templates of the notification center is rolling out within the CDK design 
                            teams. Through this internship, it helped teach me to process interaction patterns and product 
                            architecture from a more holistic point-of-view. <b>Understanding the range of edge cases that apply to 
                            numerous different products and aggregating it all into generalized patterns, it helped me explore the evolution of past needs 
                            in their context to future requirements</b>.</p>

                        <h2>Role</h2>
                        <p>During my internship at Formlabs, I spent 10 weeks <b>defining the user/team/group information and relationship 
                            architecture in the Dashboard entity ecosystem</b>. The responsibilities that my role entailed included working 
                            with the Dashboard product manager and designer to understand and architect a more usable platform due to the 
                            addition of enterprise scaling with Fleet Control.</p>

                        <h2>The problem</h2>
                        <p class="problem-statement">How might we improve the UX architecture of the entities to eliminate the need for admins to scatter their 
                            company printer fleets between teams? </p>
                    
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>My final designed prototypes have a new information and entity architecture for Dashboard based on market landscape 
                            analysis, architecture concept iterations, and high-fidelity designs sign up, onboarding, and company setting flows.
                            This design affected 4.2% of customer accounts (~50 companies), helping simplify their mental models and user flows.</p>

                            similar to or different from Dashboard, then extrapolate that information into different 
                            information architectures suitable for the platform. Levels of access and permissions need 
                            to fleshed out due to lack of internal understanding for accounts and admins.

                        <p>With the handoff of the designs to the Dashboard UX/UI designer, the next step is to further refine the details 
                            of the workflows users would take, alongside mapping out the financial pricing plan for enterprise level Fleet Control.</p>

                        <p>With the handoff of the designs to the Dashboard designer, the next step is to further refine the details of the workflows, alongside 
                            mapping out the financial pricing plan for enterprise scaling due to the architectural changes.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top:-40px">Throughout this internship and project, it taught me autonomy and how to communicate opinions and decisions 
                            more effectively. Moving forward from this internship, I want to keep tackling complex problems that deal with access and permissions 
                            to further refine my own opinions on user role based designs. It was a great experience for me to tip my toes into, and I'm thankful
                            of my team for helping throughout this project and term :) </p>

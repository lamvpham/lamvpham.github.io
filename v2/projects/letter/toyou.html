                <h1>*damn that's crazy, I put this off until mid <s>January</s> February, oops xd</h1>
                <h1> The first bit of 2023 has already got me stressed and doing so much.  
                    There's always something happening and it keeps pushing me in multiple directions. 
                    <i>Keep in mind that the tense of writing changes based on when I wrote each part.</i></h1>
                <h1>One and a half weeks have passed since I flew back from San Francisco; I flew right 
                    before the huge snowstorm fucked over a lot of flights and travel. Coming home to a heater, 
                    bath mats, and a clean house is honestly a sad way to realize how terrible my living situation 
                    was in Redwood City with Cindie. But that's okay, it's over and I'm happy to be back in 
                    Cambridge/Waterloo.</h1>
            
                <h1>---</h1>

                <h1>Dear me of 2023,</h1>
                <h1>It's been a crazy year. So much has happened, and I'm honestly quite exhausted as I 
                    begin writing it all out. Jobs, school, people, life - it's all been a lot for me to 
                    handle and I worry I'm leaving 2022 a little more cynically than last year.</h1>


                <h2>Things that happened, a recap</h2>
                <h3 class="override-top-m">Career/Design</h3>
                <h1>After getting the Formlabs offer early, I managed to sweep past all the stress from 2B 
                    job hunting. It was everything I wanted and more - the company, culture, team, and work 
                    as all amazing. I got to work on a big project that I still talk about in interviews to 
                    this day, and I'm thankful that they gave me that opportunity. From there, I sent a fuck 
                    ton of cold emails. some of which was from WaterlooWorks. One stuck, and I got Level Home 
                    rather early on in the hunt in 3A - one 30 minute call and that was it?? Crazy.</h1>
                <h1>Moving forward, I started an early job hunt in end of August for a job this Summer 2023, 
                    and I got barely anything from hundreds of applications to this day (10/2/23). It's dry out 
                    here, but I managed Roblox, Palantir, and Majestik, all of which I bombed hardcore. At this point, 
                    I'm a little worried for my last coop, but I still have hope. Right now, I'm in the midst of 3 
                    companies - Meta, Dusty Robotics, and Wellspring. Though this may be a letter supposed to be about 
                    2022, the final job hunt is driving me insane, and it's bleeding into the new year for sure.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/trips</h3>
                <h1>My life in 2022 has been absolutely exhausting in positive and negative ways. The highs were high, 
                    and the lows were low. Starting off 2022, I flew to Boston for my internship at Formlabs, only to be 
                    scammed out $2k USD and homeless. It was a rough time trying to find a place to stay while also 
                    balancing my mental state. Besides that whole thing, Boston was a crazy time; meeting Josh, Vedan, 
                    and Imaad, getting COVID, exploring the city and more, my first NBA game, parties, travelling to Newport, 
                    mom visiting Boston, Avery visiting Boston soon after, going to NYC to visit Sam and then coming back to 
                    Boston, the St. Patty's Day parade, MIT tour day, the observatory, and ending it on renting a yacht and 
                    soon after coming to NYC to visit Sam and the twins, then coming back to Boston with them. There is 
                    probably so much that I'm missing here, but that's okay, I lived life, and that's what matters.</h1>
                <h1>Coming back to Waterloo was an interesting time, and a tough term for sure. It wasn't exactly the 
                    most eventful, but Avery's apartment did get roaches, so she basically moved into my place. There was 
                    also the beach thing for my birthday, which was honestly very nice of everyone to do with me, but it was 
                    whelming unfortunately haha. Onwards to the ending of the term, Sam and I trekked a long way to Toronto 
                    during the Rogers outage only to have the Weeknd concert postponed. It was such a tragic time, but life 
                    just gets in the way and there's only so much you can do. At least there was Anders, which was a good time 
                    with Andrew and all. There was also Anime North, which was a good time - bought some cool stuff, and had a 
                    good experience overall.</h1>
                <h1>From there was the family trip to Alaska with an initial stop at Vancouver and Kelowna. We should've flown
                    straight to Kelowna first lol. But the hiking was beautiful (the Stawamus Chief hike though was the most 
                    brutal thing I've experience in a while), and the wine tasting was pretty dang good. The trips around 
                    Vancouver was also a great nostalgic time. I met up with Andy, and I had to call him out on being a terrible 
                    friend as of late, and we really haven't talked since. Besides that though, the Alaska cruise was gorgeous, 
                    and a once in a lifetime trip... but maybe later in life I'll come back. Soon after we got home was the trip 
                    to St. Catherines with Avery and that was lovely of her but I'm also tired as fuck at this point.</h1>
                <h1>From there was the last term of 2022 - California. So much happened here, good and bad, but I couldn't have 
                    done it without Vedan and Imaad. I met so many cool Apple interns and explored quite a bit, only to fly back 
                    to Toronto 3 weeks in because of the Weeknd concert being postponed until then. The concert was mind-blowing 
                    though, and I'd do that trip again with no hesitation - I would hope that it'd be better spaced out next time 
                    because I don't think anyone missed me enough yet. Back in the Bay area, I had the trip to Yosemite, which had 
                    a memorable first night due to me being too drunk. But after that, it was a fun and exciting time, where we took 
                    one of the hardest trails for some reason too late in the day. Coming back home was a bunch of parties and 
                    explorations and good food and lots of thrifting. There was a trip to Napa Valley for a wine tasting, and I 
                    was too poorly dressed for it!!! So embarrassing, but all good with Imaad's button-up. We were bousie bitches 
                    that day. This was also the same time that Sam made her way over to SF, and we explored and had a decent time, 
                    though it was definitely mid compared to NYC. Right after Sam left, was when Avery arrived, and we immediately 
                    went for a water lantern festival. Beautiful opener to her time in Cali, but not without its arguments. We 
                    travelled around, and I showed her some great spots, and then we flew over to LA for the first time each. The 
                    sights were beautiful, but also exhausting within itself. Some NBA games, some museums, some concerts, and 
                    some views. After Avery left, soon after was the Vegas trip, and it was everything I expected it to be. So 
                    many lights, so much alcohol and strippers, so much money. The group going was very fun, and we all lost a 
                    lil money except Michael, who earned $1200 USD. Insane!!! There was the Post Malone concert though, so still 
                    extremely worthwhile. Literally right after that though, Mom and Dad came to visit, and we ran back a similar 
                    itinerary from Avery's trip over. SF -> LA, with a mix of that long ass fight for a discounted rental Avis 
                    car. From there was just the Apple Christmas party, and ending my term at Level Home on a decent enough note. 
                    The end of the term ended on a melancholic goodbye, with me, Imaad, and Vedan saying goodbye for a little 
                    while. Flying back to Canada, I just missed the  the snowstorm that delayed so many flights, and the flooding 
                    in SF as well (which ultimately delayed my security deposit and I was pissed as fuck - I'm not gonna go into 
                    the whole Cindie situation here because I'd rather forget it than to say her name once more). Christmas with 
                    the family was a pleasant time, and New Year's with Avery, Josh and Sam's friends was a good time. It was 
                    great seeing Josh again, and I know that I'll see him again soon enough.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>Over a year has passed since dating Avery, and it's been a very hectic time being together. From going long 
                    distance right off the bat, to her basically living with me in the summer, to long distance yet again. 
                    It's been a journey with a lot of ups and downs. With September and January having almost making us break 
                    up, it's been hard for sure. But I know that I love this girl, and I want to work on it together.</h1>
                <h1>Avery met my parents soon after I came back in Waterloo during the summer term, and since then, my parents 
                    have come to like her quite a bit. I've met her family once, and somehow her whole extended family knows and 
                    likes me? Word spreads fast with huh. We've also done some trips together, such as exploring Boston, SF, and 
                    LA together, alongside smaller dates around the GTA and KW area.</h1>
                <h1>Moving forward with this relationship, I want to explore new things together, personally and externally. We 
                    can do this, together.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/etc</h3>
                <h1>Throughout the year, I've experienced so many new things - people, sights, things. It's been a year that I 
                    won't forget, for better or worse, and it makes me reminisce on the memories of what once was.</h1>
                <h1>New music was discovered, new playlists for each term. I started learning salsa in the summer term with Sam, 
                    and I continue that with Avery this winter term in January 2023. I continued with volleyball in summer and 
                    now, and I love being a setter. Maybe this year I'll get into boxing, who knows? Lately, I've also had this 
                    urge to explore new hobbies, such as embroidery, and past ones, like boxing. I was supposed to get my 
                    motorcycle license in the Bay are with Imaad, but maybe this year I'll get that done.</h1>
                <h1>Besides that, I've also tried therapy again during my time at Level. It wasn't anything particularly 
                    enlightening, and the time was short, but I feel like it was a good attempt to explore where my mind 
                    currently is at. Maybe with future opportunities, I can continue therapy at a more leisurely pace to 
                    work on myself.</h1>
                <h1>2022 was also the year I went to so many concerts - John Mayer, Anders, the Weeknd, the Chainsmokers, Alaina 
                    Castillo, Post Malone, SF Symphony - and they all vibrated their frequencies into my mind. I love it, and I 
                    just went to the Eden concert with Leon and his friend in Toronto the other day, and later this term, I'm 
                    gonna go to the Keshi concert with Avery. I'm thrilled to continue experiencing new things, and live music 
                    is a definite plus to my life.</h1>
                <h1>Museums in the east coast are incredible btw.</h1>


                <h2>List of close friends that I hold close to my heart this year</h2>
                <h1>People are becoming places, and I can't be everywhere at once.</h1>
                <h1>Sam: always been there for me (or for the most part, - you still suck at texting but you have been getting a 
                    little better and I'm proud). A few weeks ago in January you confided in how you want to be a better friend 
                    to me, and that you appreciate me, and I'm thankful. I can see how you've changed over the time that we've 
                    known each other, and I think it's amazing seeing you grow and work on yourself.</h1>
                <h1>Vedan: You were a new friend to me this year, and it was a very polarizing experience for the better. I'm 
                    sorry for not being as good as a friend back in Boston, but since Summerloo and SF, I feel like we've grown 
                    closer. This coming 4th year will be a crazy experience, living together, but it'll be fun. I hope that this 
                    winter/summer term doesn't push us apart too much.</h1>
                <h1>Josh: After seeing you again on New Year's, I'm hopeful that I'll be back in the Bay Area. If that happens, 
                    we can hangout again and have crazy times just like during Boston. If not, then maybe some trips will happen
                    during summer? At the least, there's that Europe trip where we'll visit Imaad and Vedan for the bull run. 
                    Besides, we'll be living together in 4th year too so you know it'll be great.</h1>
                <h1>Laura: Despite our limited times together the past year, I feel as though we are still close friends. I wish 
                    that there can be more opportunities for our paths to cross, but we're both busy with opposite schedules. 
                    Maybe in the future, when school settles down and life picks up for the both of us.</h1>
                <h1>Raewyn: I love our sassy friendship, it makes me feel as though you bring out the best of my funny side. I'm 
                    sad to see you drop a year, but I am proud and excited for what you'll do moving forward. SYDE isn't the same 
                    without you, and I hope we can reconnect again in summer.</h1>
                <h1>Imaad: Meeting in Boston, to Summerloo, to the Bay area; I feel as though despite the year together, there's 
                    still a slight wall between us. I'll work on it, and hopefully you will too. I appreciate our friendship, and 
                    I want us to be better friends moving forward. I'll see you in Spain this coming summer, and maybe that'll be 
                    the catalyst. I still remember our time at the Warriors game; we had a great chat together and I want to make 
                    sure that that memory doesn't lose itself.</h1>
                <h1>Note that Keaton and Andy aren't listed this time around - things have changed, and times are changed. After the 
                    whole Malak shit and Keaton blmaing me and Sam for not helping, I decided to take a step back from the friendship.
                    It wasn't healthy anymore, and I felt frustrated with who he's becoming. Even now, he's in a regressed state of who 
                    he once was, and it's sad to see. With Andy, after calling him out in Vancouver, we both haven't reached out to each 
                    other. Life's busy for the both of us, and I don't think each of us want to make the first move.</h1>


                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <h1>With 2023 already underway, there are a lot of things to look forward to with this year. It already started out 
                    better than 2022, that's for sure. I've learnt my lessons, and I'll ensure that I have proper living conditions 
                    with good roommates, I promise myself.</h1>
                <h1>Volunteering with Sam this term didn't pan out, but maybe for 4th year if I have time? I see the work you're 
                    putting out there to donate food and volunteer, and I respect the morality. I also have new hobbies that I want 
                    to continue exploring, and I know that the past 2 months in 2023 have been hectic as hell, but I hope that I can 
                    carve time to work on them. It's just that with the final co-op coming up, it's been a huge time suck and I'm 
                    wasting away at finding a job that I can enjoy and continue into full-time hopefully. We'll see where I land and 
                    where life takes me.</h1>
                <h1>The elective situation was not great at all, with the back and forth for Tech Art and my Cognitive Science minor. 
                    This term I'm taking Psych of Evil and Metaphysics & Epistemology, and I wish I had the mental space to enjoy it 
                    while it happens in front of me, but for now, I'll keep up with taking notes and maybe I can learn more about them 
                    later.</h1>
                <h1>NYC reading week never panned out, but I'm writing this as I'm about to head to Toronto with Sam for a 3 day mini 
                    trip. It wasn't what I anticipated, but it'll still be a fun time. There's also future trips to look forward to, 
                    such as the Vietnam trip at the end of the winter term, the summer co-op location with a mix of maybe Vegas/NYC/Seattle/etc, 
                    theres also the South Africa trip with Avery at the end of summer term, and then maybe at the end of the year we 
                    can do some cottage trips or another lil mini trip somewhere warm!</h1>
                <h1>It's nearing graduation, and just about a year from now, I'll be out of school. Maybe I'll do a Masters of Business, 
                    or that MIT Media Lab in the far future. I'm excited to see where life takes me, and I need to remember that 
                    nothing is permanent. Things will change, and with the bad comes the good, and vise versa. We'll see what happens, 
                    but just know that I'm learning as a person. I'm flawed, and that's a good thing.</h1>
                <h1 class="spacing-b">Though it's year of the Cat, next year is back to year of the Dragon, so next year will most definitely be my year.</h1>

                <h1>The snow is slowly melting outside as it steadily creeps closer to 2022, and I'm 
                    sitting at home wearing my red, oversized, arts sweater. The evening is dark and cold, 
                    with the hazy shadows of the night's sky casting a somber light indoors. It's December 30, 
                    2021, and it feels like I've been living this year with my eyes wide shut; how is it already 
                    the end of the year? </h1>
                <h1>So I write this to myself, a year from now, to take a look back on me at the start of this year 
                    to where I am right now.</h1>

                <h1>---</h1>

                <h1>Dear me of 2022,</h1>
                <h1>As 2021 leaves me, the bitter taste of retrograde remains in my mouth. Reflecting on 
                    everything that's occurred in my life this year, there's so much to say, yet the words 
                    escape me still. I'd like to think that I did everything right, and that my instincts 
                    brought me to a happier state of mind - but that is simply untrue. My interactions and 
                    experiences with myself and others were riddled with mistakes and misgivings, but that doesn't 
                    and shouldn't define me. It's how I rectify them and move forward.</h1>

                <h2>Things that happened, a recap</h2>
                <h3 class="override-top-m">Career/Design</h3>
                <h1>A lot of things happened this year, and what I'm about to list out are merely the ones I 
                    can currently remember, though there is probably much more that evade my train of thought. 
                    Starting the year off in terms of work and design, the project about Discover Together was 
                    finally wrapped up with the Aphrodite Project partnering up with us. </h1>
                <h1>As well, I applied to 300 jobs within the span of January to April - applications, LinkedIn 
                    messages, cold emails... there were the highs of hearing from Google and Twitch, and the lows 
                    of Pencil and Tulip bullshit. I was too egotistical, thinking that with Watsi and Synqrinus, 
                    I was ahead of the bunch. And to be far, I guess I was, but that did cause me to become conceited 
                    in what I wanted. I ended up doing interviews and design challenges for Lacework, Panasonic, and 
                    CDK Global during exam season at the end of April. Rejection, rejection, job, respectively. Finally 
                    got CDK Global at the end of April, and it started in June so I had 6 weeks to recover and regain 
                    my composure. </h1>
                <h1>That was the most burnt out I've been in ages, and that was a carried over continuation from the 
                    end of 2020 with my mental low of the breakup with Norah. Past that, I had high hopes for Loo Labs, 
                    but once Aman and Queenie left, Jeff decided to make uncanny decisions that left me out in the sun to 
                    dry. Him and Carolina fucked me over, and I do not plan on revisiting those memories here, but Olya 
                    and myself bonded over our mutual anger of the fallout there (which by the way, I should reach out 
                    to her again, it's been a while). </h1>
                <h1>But know that things did pick up after the fact, with Formlabs initially ghosting me in January, 
                    only to give me the job in May. I deferred the offer to January 2022, and that gave me so much peace 
                    of mind this fall term. There was no need for me to look for a job while everyone else was stressed 
                    with balancing 2B and interviews, but I'm thriving in that aspect. Boston will be a great change of 
                    pace for me mentally, and I'm excited to see what comes out of it. Only concerns right now are COVID 
                    to board my plane, and the high levels of infection there, but that's a later issue that hopefully 
                    will work itself out.</h1>
                <h1>Besides the coop hustle, I got the opportunity to volunteer at Watsi. It was an on and off thing, but 
                    was a good step towards what I can potentially see myself thriving to do in the future. Synqrinus also 
                    reached out with a little more work, but I finally cut the rope and they no longer are my freelancing 
                    connection. The money was great, but I'm happier with that load off my shoulders. As well, many 
                    other startups have been reaching out to me, asking me to join them as lead designers, and that 
                    excites me. Not because I can work with them, but because there is already a foundation for my name 
                    being known and my skills being wanted. My ego is happy, but there is still a long road ahead of me.</h1>
            
                <h3>Personal life/trips</h3>
                <h1>Sam, Raewyn, Chidi, and I were gonna go to Vancouver for the summer term to work remotely. But the flair 
                    of the Brazilian variant scared Raewyn, and she bailed. Understandable, but still uncanny when she still 
                    moves to Toronto anyways. We (well really I) dealt with an extremely unhappy landlord, and we lost $400 
                    each to the security deposit.</h1>
                <h1>So instead, I decided to go to Vancouver at the end of the summer term anyways because fuck COVID, I'm 
                    tryna at least live a lil and see Keaton and Andy. I visited two days before the end of the CDK term in 
                    Surrey with Keaton, then went over to Vancouver with Andy after a few days. The weather was beautiful, 
                    and I felt blessed. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>Besides that, Sam and I spontaneously decided to go to NYC during reading week. Absolutely no regrets; the 
                    trip was incredible, we did so much and drank practically every day. Met Zarwan, met Jaimie; ate good food, 
                    drank good drinks. The influence I've had on Sam has made her more spontaneous and social, and it's great 
                    seeing her be happy. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>With those trips, the second half of the fall term, I've been a little more frugal with money. Had a talk 
                    with Sam, and we both agreed that it's not necessarily because we are broke, but because you can always earn 
                    back money, but you can't get back experiences. Truly no regrets.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>The start of the year was with her living rent free in my head, and still to this day. It's draining, emotionally 
                    saddening, and sometimes I wish things could've worked out differently. But it happens the way it does, and I 
                    can't regret that. I've learnt a lot this year, where I've gotten to a more introspective state of mind. I noticed 
                    everyone puts too much emphasis in the words people say as the basis for their character from that person's 
                    perspective, rather than the smaller actions that portray them much better than the words of someone unaware 
                    or still learning about themselves. Read through the previous journal posts to see my growth, experiences, and 
                    thoughts.</h1>
                <h1>Besides all this, I've dated around. Notable ones were Sarah, where she progressively became more and more 
                    two-dimensional. It was a situationship/friends 
                    with benefits. Pity and loneliness was the motivator there, and I hope the best for her, just without me. I also met 
                    Jaimie in NYC, and we vibed well. We had a one night stand, but I realized how empty that makes me feel, and how 
                    I become more emotionally attached. I require the emotion to drive a relationship and sex, so that taught me 
                    something at least. Meeting and chatting with so many others, my friends and I realized that I pull, which is 
                    cool for my ego, but nothing ever panned out. I met Lucy, who ended up telling me I was soft and had no red flags, 
                    so she wasn't attracted. What the fuck is that about? I don't know. I was on the verge of just shutting it down and 
                    picking it up in Boston to at least make friends, but right before that, I met Avery. We just clicked, looking for 
                    the same thing at the same time. Right person, right time? It sure feels that way; things are still fresh, so we'll 
                    see how things go from here. Don't be hasty, me. Don't let my past mistakes repeat with Avery, please.</h1>
                
                <h3>Personal life/etc</h3>
                <h1>With everything above, there was much more that happened. Failed my G test once due to a stupid, minor thing, 
                    but finally passed the second time after worrying my license would expire before I come back from Boston. 
                    Same, Keaton, Olya, and I also worked on the Poster Project, and things were optimistic but eventually died 
                    out. Good concept, but lacked motivation and drive. I also had a loose screw in my jaw from the surgery, so 
                    I went through a rough time removing that. That also includes the infected ear at the end of fall term, and 
                    hives at the beginning of the year. So lots of medical fuckups to my body. Alongside all this, I finally decided 
                    to try out therapy. It wasn't too particularly helpful, but it 
                    helped consolidate my thoughts on certain things (check out my draft on the sessions). So much more that I 
                    probably forgot about, but this is the general jist.</h1>

                <h2>List of close friends that I hold close to heart this year</h2>
                <h1>Sam - we're as close as ever. Of course there was a few hiccups here and there, but it's notable that we both 
                    value our friendship together and don't want anything to get in the way of that. NYC was wonderful, we have 
                    very similar boundaries and thought processes, same standards with school. She opened up about how she's 
                    gonna be pretty sad while I'm gone, but I trust that she'll be alright and that she'll be in good company 
                    with Keaton and the twins. </h1>
                <h1>Keaton - after seeing him again since end of 2019 in Surrey, he's a close friend of mine. Still slightly naive 
                    and young, but he'll grow. Sam and I talked about this and how I leave a strong influence on people, and I 
                    suppose that's true. He values what me and Sam think, though probably not academically (lol). That's okay, 
                    I'm excited to see how he'll prosper, but first, he needs to be less cringe and more open minded.</h1>
                <h1>Andy - it's like time never really passed. Seeing him again in Van, we were bros just like before he left. 
                    He's in his prime, with a great environment to thrive, and I hope he learns to be more warm. He may be empathetic, 
                    but he still has ways to go when it comes to being less self-centred. We facetime often to update each other on 
                    life, but it does sometimes feel like he isn't too interested in what I have to say with my life. Jordan is giving 
                    him perspective on the tech industry, which is amazing, but I worry what he's causing to Andy's mental state 
                    after the cheating incident. </h1>
                <h1>Laura - same old, same old. We don't talk constantly, but we do love to catch up every so often, and that 
                    is what works for us. She's adjusting to Ryerson, but I believe in her. Manifesting good energy for her, 
                    she'll do just fine. We've always had the same thoughts for some things, but I really appreciate her perspective 
                    when it comes to some of my problems and things I do. It's really grounding, what she does for me.</h1>
                <h1>Raewyn - crazy ass mofo, and I fucking love that for her. Middle of 2B, we said fuck school, let's have a 5 
                    hour discussion on life and our personal lives. We found out that despite having such different upbringings, 
                    we have such a scarily similar thought process and opinion on life, people, and other things. At the end of 
                    the term, she told me that she's her most truest and most comfortable version of herself with me, and I 
                    really treasured that. You're a really lit ass fucker, and I value our friendship. #homies4life, but seriously 
                    tho, where the podcast at?</h1>
                
                <h2>Reflections on this year and my learnings on self, life, and moving forward</h2>
                <h1>The first thing I want to tell you is that time doesn't fully heal wounds. At least, not for me. I feel 
                    that I am forever in motion with the past, and Laura always tells me that same thing. That I'm too hung up 
                    on things that already passed. I am forced by my program to constantly think about the future, and I'm 
                    trying to live in the moment when I can, but I psychologically get too caught up in the past. </h1>
                <h1 class="spacing-b">But that's okay. 2021 me is working through things, and I hope the me that's reading this a year from now 
                    is thriving. Currently in love w/ philosophy, psychology, cinematography, drawing, blogging, poetry, 
                    volleyball, board games, music production, sneakers, and so much more. I made 4 new playlists each month that describes 
                    my moods during that time. I wrote numerous journal posts that explore a more vulnerable and introspective version of myself - 
                    meant for myself but left public for anyone that cares to read it. Boston -> Waterloo -> where next 
                    for my 5th coop (hopefully NYC, SF, or Norway). There are trips lined up for next year, where the end of 
                    Formlabs is when Sam and (hopefully twins + others) come visit me in Boston/NYC for a lit ass time before 
                    in-person 3A rips us a new one. Middle/end of August, family wants to go on a cruise in Alaska, and staying 
                    in Vancouver for a few days afterwards. Who knows where else I'll be in 2022, but I hope you know that every 
                    little thing will be okay, Lam. Things always work out, one way or another. </h1>

            <div id="2020" class="content fade-in hide">
                <h4>New beginnings</h4>

                <h1>Begin each year with the end in mind. That's what I'm telling myself right now, and I hope that a year 
                    today will be exactly how I hope it to be. </h1>
                <h1>But let's recap 2020. Moved out and lived in Toronto with Laura, Andrew, and Anna. Had a great time 
                    working at BlueCat and ending the shift hanging out with Sam, or heading to a restaurant with Rae,
                    or going to the gym and cooking. I learned HTML/CSS and coded my website, which got me great positions.
                    I was feeling great, being social and productive, living life. I still rode that vibe going into the 
                    pandemic, which was when I met Norah. 6 months; 1 month of falling in love, 5 months of being in love, 
                    and the end of 2020 with sadness and heartbreak. Breakups are much easier to deal with when you're not 
                    couped up at home 24/7. My saving grace was Sam, Keaton, Laura, Andy. Through the depression and mental 
                    booms caused by 1B and Norah, I need to grow as a person still. Don't we all?</h1>
                <h1>Though Norah did take up most of my year, I learned how to deepen my friendships and slowly learn to love 
                    myself. I had the cheating scandal with 112, and that was horrible but that's now past me. Had the surgery, 
                    and though it wasn't exactly how I envisioned it to be, it's over now and I can move forward. Worked on 
                    Communifund, a side project about deepening community bonds. Let's list out what I did:</h1>
                <h1>· UWPM</h1>
                <h1>· Enlight</h1>
                <h1>· Loo Labs</h1>

                <h1>· new ideas!</h1>
                <h1>-> and much more that I don't remember. This is when I was at my lowest and super unmotivated, so imagine 
                    what'll happen when I'm at my highest.</h1>

                <h1>Started 2020 in Niagara Falls with Andy and Jacob, this time I'm gonna start with Laura and Debbie. 2021's 
                    gonna be hype - podcast launch, new portfolio, new coop, summer in Vancouver/Montreal/? with Rae, DT x 
                    Aphrodite and maybe Bumble + others, maybe even befriending Norah again or/and finding new love.</h1>

                <h1 class="spacing-b">This year's for me. Losing sight of what's important means my eyes are open. This is my time, 2021.</h1>

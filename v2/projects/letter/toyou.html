                <h1>The winter snow cycles between that falling to the ground and melting in heaps. I've grown 
                    tired of the pattern and weather - I want something new (and it'll be coming at me in the next 
                    few weeks). Sitting at home and typing out this annual report always feels like a chore, but 
                    I never regret it the following year when I read about how different my life has become. Hopefully, 
                    2025 brings me positive change that I've been waiting for.

                <h1>Continuing the trend of resilience at the cost of my mental health, the job hunt was exceptionally 
                    brutal with the market being so trash this year. Reapplying to KP never landed me anywhere, 
                    and all new grad positions for design were overinflated with applicants. It was the luck of 
                    the draw, and I always ended up with the short end of the stick.
                </h1>

                <h1>I was so close with 8VC, but no portfolio company wanted me (what a strange pattern like with KP 
                    in 2023). So the strategy to apply to jobs I'm extremely unqualified for was the play - and it 
                    worked to some extent. I applied to companies, and some notable ones were:
                </h1>

                <h1 class="list">· Exa (doing the interview on the car ride to the airport for my grad trip)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Autonomous (the european dream - maybe next year..?)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Ramp (I fumbled so hard with a screening call lol),</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Konrad (fuck that last round 4 hour bs)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Julius AI (I did not expect them to not even know what to talk about)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Bland AI (the CTO is such a dick, and he's younger than me?? I still haven't been paid yet)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Argo Labs (I had a fever in VN while doing the design challenge lol)</h1>
                <h1 class="list">· Windborne (I wish I got this but I was hopelessly underprepared)</h1>

                <h1>Amongst other interviews and companies that I ended up screwing up. Hard spamming cold emails 
                    and getting at least 1 interview per week during summer was nice despite everyone on Reddit 
                    complaining about how they couldn't even get 1 interview, but it really took a toll on me 
                    since I failed basically every single call.
                </h1>

                <h1>Was it the ever-decreasing interest and passion for design? Was I just not as good as I thought 
                    I was? Was the market that bad?
                </h1>

                <h1>Thoughts like this circled my mind constantly, and while I continued through the trenches to 
                    apply, I had no energy to actually try with them. What a vicious cycle I put myself through.
                </h1>

                <h1>In the end though, Argo Labs worked out and my late night suffering in Vietnam while doing 
                    these interviews helped get me a month trial. Lots of issues with the manager arised, like 
                    calling me a prospect 3 weeks into the trial run and not knowing if he wants to actually hire 
                    me, to dodging my messages for my contract renewal, to my FT offer letter and TN visa being 
                    delayed because he doesn't care to respond specifically to me while on vacation. Typical techbro 
                    behaviour with a lack of empathy, I question my motivation for this gig everyday, but I need a 
                    job and the money for right now. 
                </h1>

                <h1>Maybe things will change in the new year once I'm in person, but the fear of him rescinding my FT
                    offer looms over me still.

                <h1>Starting the year off with a relaxing Nordic Spa with Sam, it was very relaxing time before raging 
                    at the Travis Scott concert with Josh. Toronto was in the middle of a blizzard, and Josh and I 
                    bought a mickey of tequila to share at a burger joint before the concert - I'm surprised we weren't 
                    kicked out of there lmao. Soon after was the start of the last term of UW SYDE, and it was getting 
                    a little melancholic tbh. The roomies went sledding in the backyard of our place, and planed for a 
                    winter Apres Ski party but fell through due to very bad weather. I caught up with friends like Raewyn 
                    in Toronto and dinner with the twins, brunch with Stephanie, lunch with Gabby, etc. etc. And with the 
                    last term being full of celebrations for engineering, did a brewery tour, we went to Phils one last time, 
                    had our Iron Ring Ritual, SYDE breakfast kegger, IRS, did Boats twice LOL once in someone's backyard 
                    in the cold and another in our backyard which was shut down by our landlord. Vedan, Josh, and I drove 
                    over to New Jersey during reading week and relaxed / got wasted in NYC with Imaad, and it was a calm 
                    time hanging out together before Imaad had to go back to North Carolina as we explored Hoboken. Another 
                    celebration was with Gradball, where we celebrated with Julie, Will, and Gaston as we played poker to pre. 
                    It was a great night of eating and finding drink tickets to get drunk with, while saying hi to people I 
                    rarely see. There was Josh's birthday potluck, then soon after was St. Pattys which was the first time 
                    I've ever experienced it, and it was lowkey a mess of an experience, with Josh almost getting arrested 
                    and being exhausted from our party the night before. There was the Capstone showcase in March, where we 
                    presented our Capstone to the public, to which I also did the same for my CS/FINE art (I was late because 
                    I accidentally ordered Harvey's at the King St. location using a coupon and was committed to not wasting 
                    my money). After was the Solar Eclipse, which we drove to Hamilton for, then the SYDE Toast, which was 
                    kind of made me realize how uninvolved I was in the SYDE community, but also accepting that I just wasn't 
                    a fit for that type of people. Amidst all this was me dating around lol, but that's saved for the later 
                    section of the letter.

                <h1>Phase 1 - London and Madrid with Sam: It was honestly such a relaxing and great time with her, where 
                    London was a lil underwhelming but a nice ease into a month long trip. Exploring hella museums that 
                    was stolen by the British was fun and all, but the museum fatigue set in pretty quick. British tea in 
                    Cambridge was enjoyable, but it's a shame we didn't have time to try the full British breakfast. Madrid 
                    was where the fun came in, where I had the best coffee, the worst paella tourist trap food that I couldn't 
                    even finish, and the 7 story club was such a great vibe. Sam got me my favourite pair of jeans to date, 
                    and exploring with her was enjoyable, though her energy levels was low and we didn't drink or go out much.
                </h1>

                <h1>Phase 2 - Palma, Barcelona, Nice and Paris with Vedan and Josh: meeting up with the duo in the 
                    Palma hostel was wild because it felt like such a long time since I last saw them, but it was 
                    literally just 2 weeks. That first day in Palma was focused on trying to find food and getting 
                    lit on the party boat. Barcelona was nostalgic and initially a great time - though it was unfortunate 
                    Imaad had to cancel. I lost my phone here and it really fucked with my energy for the next while, and 
                    I tried my best to recover but it ruined my mood for the rest of the trip lowkey. At least I brought my 
                    camcorder lol. And tapas - incredible. Nice ended up being an underdog city because it was such an 
                    incredible and calm vibe but still full of energy. I was getting frustrated at Josh and Vedan but we 
                    talked it out here, we also met up with Sam and Micah at this point. Eze and Monaco were a short day 
                    trip to explore, before heading to Paris and meeting Matt and Will. Paris was honestly better than 
                    expected, and we had celebrated before Vedan had to fly back home and prepare for her adult job. 
                </h1>

                <h1>Phase 3 - Germany, Amsterdam, Lisbon, and Albufeira: Such a fever dream here, and it sucks that my 
                    social battery drained so fast at this point that I was dragging Josh down. Frankfurt was a druggie
                    hellscrape; hitting 200km/h on the autobahn; Koln was boring -> once we arrived in Amsterdam tho, 
                    it was biking, beautiful scenes, sex show, window strippers, drugs, drinks. Best museum I've ever 
                    visited was here too. Lisbon was a great vibe, and living on a boat was horrible but a fun story to 
                    tell. We got fucked up, and ended up missing our train in the morning, wasting time and then getting 
                    on the wrong train after, then finally getting on the right train to Albufeira, where we arrived late 
                    and got all you can eat ribs and walking around at night. The next day was motorcycling and a boat tour, 
                    and then getting drunk at the beach, and the last day was getting our first tattoos. Back to Lisbon, we 
                    vibed one more night before flying back home and rotting for a while.
                </h1>

                <h1>At this point, being back home was a blessing. But it didn't last, because Sam stopped talking to 
                    me, for unknown reasons. Got a new phone, caught up with friends, and starting grinding job apps 
                    like there was no tomorrow. Convocation rolled in, and it was an overwhelming blur that was exciting, 
                    yet a lil sad. Life goes by so fast, and the 4.5 years of university life is over. The adult life soon 
                    begins, and it was more depressing than I thought, and I didn't even have high expectations.

                    Vietnam -> Tokyo day trip -> Edmonton buddhist trip w/ Mom -> Florida w/ Mom and Dad</h1>

                <h1>Before fucking off and decompressing from the saddening job hunt in Vietnam, I decided to go to SF 
                    and visit all the homies again and see whatsup as a refresher. Andrew, Josh, Imaad, Vedan, Kristen, 
                    clubbing, drinking, boxing, gun range, surfing - all the fun stuff, though I did have another argument 
                    with Vedan here. The toilet got clogged and there was a shooting within 5m of each other, all while I 
                    was vibing in the car before Imaad and I could go surfing lol. After all that was the roadtrip to 
                    Seattle so that Imaad can drop off his car, Josh and Vedan go to Vancouver, and I fly to Vietnam. 
                    Once I was in Vietnam, I tried my best to relax after the cruelty of Bland AI and the summer of job 
                    hunting failure, but it was always in the back of my mind. Hanging out with cousins, working out, 
                    napping, eating good; it was all a daily cycle that was enjoyable to sit back and ride the wave. I 
                    also made a friend in Vietnam, and then also connected with my now girlfriend Annie through Tinder. 
                    Tokyo was meant to be thrifting but I ended up going to the same Shibuya Temple that the family visited 
                    before, and all the thrifting spots I went to were so expensive. And I was exhausted from a lack of sleep, 
                    so it was kinda wasted time but whatever. At least I got a job? And a girlfriend lol. Back in Cambridge 
                    was a state of languish and exhaustion, mixed with hanging out with Carter, Laura, Imaad, and Krystal, 
                    with the addition of calling Annie and ignoring my work time to chat with her. It was difficult adjusting 
                    coming back from Vietnam straight into a chaotic workplace, so an Edmonton trip was slightly refreshing, 
                    albeit mainly for mom's enjoyment. I'm officially a buddhist now, as we stayed in the temple most of the 
                    time, and helped around. After that was a focus on finding a place in NYC and booking a flight, plus the 
                    annoyance of trying to get my manager to give me a job + offer letter + TN visa. Now it's just about Florida 
                    for the end of year with mom and dad, before flying out to NYC and officially starting my adult life. Too 
                    bad it was essentially an uncomfortable and boring trip that just wasted my time and energy. At least I 
                    meet Eric and Tommy, alongside getting some cool clothes.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>The embers of my relationship with Avery still weighed on my mind for a lot of this year, and it 
                    made me delude myself on dates with girls, where I tried hard but honestly didn't even care for 
                    them. Mentally, I was still working on myself, but was exhausted and feeling alone despite my friends 
                    being roommates and travelling with them constantly throughout the year. Who I was a year ago and many 
                    years ago, compared to who I am now as I'm writing this, are two entirely different people, and even 
                    Josh and Vedan noted that to me. My energy levels are lower, my confidence is definitely not the same 
                    and as outlandish as it once was - but maybe it's for the best that I stop being so deluded.

                <h1>Some notable girls from this year that I dated that I learned something:
                </h1>

                <h1 class="list">· Amy in Winter term, where she was such a horrible texter. I lacked confidence, 
                    and didn't really make any moves, which is probably why she didn't feel much of a spark and ended 
                    things. Maybe if I went to Dalai's birthday party in fall 2023, I would've met her sooner and 
                    things would've been different. 
                </h1>

                <h1 class="list">· Alice was interesting because we talked for a while online and then once I drove
                    up to Toronto to get coffee with her, the vibes weren't it. She was very shy, I still lacked 
                    confidence to make much of a move, and things just fizzled out. Never again am I driving to 
                    Toronto purely for another date lol

                <h1 class="list">· Arianne from St. Johns wanted to keep talking to me for a month before we met, when 
                    she flew over to Toronto. It was such an awkward date, because I realized how boring and privileged 
                    she was, and she was ignorant to it all while still being super shy. Turns out she really liked
                    me and was nervous as hell, since she got out of a 7 year relationship and I was her first date since.

                    officially dating for pretty much 2 months now. Things are good, and I'm excited for what's to come,

                <h3>Personal life/etc.</h3>
                <h1>The whole Sam situation was such a mess this second half of the year, and I don't personally want 
                    to get more into it again. If she decides to reach out in the future, I'll give her to courtesy of 
                    getting coffee and figuring out where things went wrong, but I can't become friends with someone 
                    capable of such disrespectful immaturity. </h1>

                <h1>Besides that, NYC is getting closer by the day, and I've met my roommates, leased a place in Lower East 
                    Side, and booked my flight over on Jan. 11, 2025. Let's hope that Aidan pulls through with my TN visa. 
                    Moving to NYC, besides my work, my ulterior motive for 2025 is leaning more into the arts scene there 
                    and refining my craft. Sunstokes is a wip currently, but I'm excited for it and my newfound hobby of 
                    camcording. I really want creative coding / creative technologist / art director / creative director 
                    to be my next role, because I'm so sick of Product Design. Who knows what will happen in NYC though.</h1>

                <h1><b>Annie - </b>Though we are still early into our relationship, you have been such a supportive and 
                    caring person that I appreciate having by my side. I never anticipated getting into a relationship 
                    right before NYC during such a fluid time in my life, but I'm thankful to have met you, and there 
                    is so much to look forward to with you and I.</h1>

                <h1><b>Carter - </b>Our friend started flourishing a lot more this year, and I'm grateful to have a 
                    friend like you to rant about life while also knowing we are not alone in this adulting lifestyle. 
                    I know things aren't great with work right now at RBC and your petty boss, but hopefully you can 
                    tough it out! Or find a better job soon lol</h1>

                <h1><b>Laura - </b>A constant in my life since 2016 - 8 years and counting. Though we may not talk 
                    constantly, I'm glad to have our friendship where I can crash at your Toronto place and we just 
                    vibe out and drink. Finally got to see you blackout wasted, and it won't be the last. Next year 
                    will be an exciting time for you with your job situation, and I just know you'll thrive in 
                    whatever spot you're in.</h1>

                <h1><b>Gabby - </b>I'm happy to have a friend like you that was in SYDE with me. Since those days 
                    of fighting for EngSoc rep, to catching up with my job in NYC and your masters in Zurich, it's 
                    always an intellectually stimulating conversation whenever we catch up. You're thriving right 
                    now, and I can't wait to visit you (maybe in 2025!)</h1>
                <img src="letter-assets/2024-imgs/33.jpg">

                <h1><b>Krystal - </b>You carried me in Hack the North last year, and since then, we became good friends 
                    that catch up over food. It's comforting to know that we are in the same situation of wanting to 
                    transition out of PD and into something more interesting, and I'm excited for what's to come for 
                    the both of us and our careers. Also, a thank you for the Creative Act book - though I didn't have 
                    the heart to tell you I already have it, it really meant a lot that you thought of me.</h1>

                <h1><b>Josh - </b>Living with you, to grad trip, to golfing, to SF; life is always a whirlwind with you 
                    and though we are on two different paths in life now, we always find a way to intersect again to 
                    fuck around and find out. Seems like you're having a blast in Vancouver, and hopefully you come 
                    visit me in NYC soon.</h1>

                <h1><b>Imaad - </b>Hanging out in Belmont made me understand each other's position in life better. 
                    From our times drinking in Waterloo this winter, to the Seattle roadtrip, I feel like though 
                    there is still a slight distance between us, next year may bring an interesting new dynamic. 
                    I hope your last year in school is savoured and you find success in a new job.</h1>
                <img src="letter-assets/2024-imgs/36.jpg">

                <h1><b>Vedan - </b>Many arguments and differences later, I do feel as though we've grown apart. We don't
                    align well with each other's personalities, but I'm glad you're finding joy and success with your new 
                    job at Apple. Our friendship may be strained, but may the coming year come with a better understanding 
                    of one another.</h1>

                <h1>Not included on this list is Sam, where it was a disappointing and frankly, depressing part of this 
                    year. From the beginning of the year and ending our last term of SYDE, to going to London and Madrid 
                    together, I did feel a slight distance starting to grow on your side. I chose to try and ignore it, 
                    continue trying to be a good friend to you. Though you may decide to reach out in the future, I'll 
                    accept the coffee and talk about all this. But I can't imagine being friends with you again. I'm not 
                    sure what happened or where it went wrong, but I wish you the best in life.</h1>

                <h1>2024 was a continually rough year, stemming from 2021, and it's been hard on me. But life goes on, 
                    right? I thought with school ending and having a full time job, my mind would be a little bit more 
                    at ease. I'd be naive to think that would finally come to fruition in 2025, but I can only pray 
                    for new beginnings bringing me some form of comfort to my mind and soul.

                    to be like stepping away from my more carefree state of mind into being an adult now. Excited and fear

                <h3 class="override-top-m">Career/design</h3>
                <h1>It's wild to think that the human condition has brought me to this state - it's oddly 
                    beautiful in its domino effect. I broke up with Avery on the due date of the KP Design 
                    Fellow application (for the second but not last time) and I wasn't going to submit it. 
                    I was unmotivated and miserable, and I texted Sam that night only for her to come over 
                    to my apartment and help me finish it.</h1>

                <h1>Due to the stupid lack of transparency from their end, I dragged out my hope there. Got 
                    semi's in mid March, got finalist in mid April, and then nothing. I held out til early/mid 
                    June, only to realize no one heard back other than the ones that got offers before the 
                    start of 2023. If Sam never came over and I didn't apply to KP, would I have put that 
                    mental energy towards the interviews I did have? Would I have let go of ego and hope to 
                    return to Formlabs or Level? All the potential opportunities I had and could've had 
                    slipped through my fingers, and other notable mentions are: 1. Duality Robotics with 
                    Alena only to realize at the bitter end they don't do visa's, 2. getting Landa, 
                    suffering through terrible management, hustling some quick bucks, and getting fired, 
                    and 3. the freelance gig Leon recommended me sucked dick due to yet another business 
                    major that can't communicate beyond the 2nd year business jargon that spews from their lips.</h1>

                <h1>This all costed me so much, and I don't know if I've fully recovered from this yet. 
                    The new grad job hunt is on, and I feel as though my skills have deprecated, my 
                    interviewing skills are weak, and the design job economy isn't looking so hot right now.</h1>

                <h1>---</h1>

                <h1>Besides actual jobs, I joined Hack the North instead of TedxUW because of Krystal, Rachel, 
                    and Leon convincing me that it'll be a great opportunity + the mentality I was in that it's 
                    my last full year so I should do something memorable. To which I did, but also costed me 
                    more than I anticipated. The drama in the beginning drained my energy for the rest of the 
                    term and bled into other aspects of my life (aka. mental health, Avery, thought process, etc). 
                    But at least the highs were decent: two enjoyable team retreats, getting all 3 of my ideas 
                    pushed with Community Bay, poster project, and spaces (discussion for the success/failure of 
                    each can be for another day). Motivation was at an all time low, and it kept dragging on til 
                    it finally finished - was it all worth it? I'm not sure, but at least I met some cool people.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/trips & life events</h3>
                <h1><b>Winter term:</b> Skiing w/ Viet -> Toronto mini-trip during Reading Week w/ Sam -> Cabin 
                    retreat with Avery -> HTN winter retreat -> Vietnam -> Berkeley w/ Gaston</h1>

                <h1>This term was, in essence, the initial bleeding out from job interviews that caused my 
                    burnout and mental health decay. I went skiing with Viet at Blue Mountain, and got 
                    news of my rejection from Meta there too. I tried to move past it, but that crippled 
                    my mental onwards. The mini-trip with Sam was chill with its thrifting 
                    and drinking, nothing too notable. The cabin retreat with Avery really sunk in the 
                    stillness that I really much needed. Getting away from the city and anything too 
                    stimulating helped me calm down from the antsy feeling I got with my scalp and finger 
                    issues amongst the job hunt and everything else. After that was the HTN retreat, which 
                    was exciting within itself when we found a half naked couple in the basement, and then 
                    having a lil organizer party on the upper floors. Bonding with everyone was nice, but 
                    I definitely felt detached - was this when I realized? Or when it finally sunk in? By 
                    the end of the term, I flew over to Vietnam, and that was fun but exhausting to deal 
                    with family as well as early morning HTN meetings and job interviews. Getting morning 
                    coffee and driving around was fun though. Food was great as always, with notable highlights 
                    of my year during this time. Flying back, I was pressured and stressed by Mom during 
                    February to pick where I'll end up flying to as my final destination, and being unsure 
                    about the whole job situation, I gambled on SF. I was wrong, and it crushed me, but I 
                    tried not to let it get the best of me as I crashed at Gaston's place in Berkeley, saying 
                    hi to Kristen and Josh, and vibing out before flying back to the paused life that awaited 
                    me at home.</h1>

                <h1>This term was really my lowest, due to a wide array of life events unfolding before me. 
                    I don't even remember what I did for my birthday besides getting charcuterie boards with 
                    Avery after she told me her mom does not like me due to her mom's own irrelevant experience. 
                    Amazing timing. Soon after, we broke up for the third time (for 2 weeks only) before 
                    getting back together. In-between was making a tote bag for Avery, 'volunteering' at 
                    Taco Fest with Sam and getting endless tacos, reading in the park, going to Elora with 
                    HTN to clear my mind, and watching a movie with Laura. Once Avery and I got back together 
                    at the Odd Duck (which was a dream-like experience within itself), Avery spontaneously 
                    agreed to go to Montreal to see Drake with me as a means to try more on her end to get 
                    out of the house more (that didn't persist). After that was the HTN summer retreat, which 
                    was fun camping and going to a casino and Niagara with everyone, but the experience felt like it just 
                    phased through me. Up next weekend was NYC with Sam, where I thrifted and explored on foot 
                    a lot, and drinking a lot as well. Explored the Figma office with Em, before heading back 
                    home. Montreal again the next weekend to go to Osheaga with Sam, and honestly, that was 
                    one of the top highlights of my year. The energy and vibe was amazing that trip and at 
                    the festival, and I enjoyed every bit of it. After those 4 weeks, I was exhausted but 
                    it was fun. Only to have the break up with Avery suck the soul out of me yet again. As 
                    I'm writing this letter, it's finally sinking in how toxic this cycle was for my self and 
                    for her as well. </h1>

                <h1><b>Fall term:</b> HTN Weekend -> Montreal w/ Vedan and Josh for Vedan's bday -> a 
                    cancelled ski trip due to lack of snow</h1>

                <h1>Coming to terms with the break up was extremely tough, but moving into my new place 
                    and seeing Vedan and Josh again after so long was what I needed. Though it was a 
                    rollercoaster of emotions, the emptiness and grey is slowly dissipating to make room 
                    everything else that's unravelling before me. The whole tenant situation was stressful 
                    but I'm not going to talk about that here - everything felt like I was being pulled 
                    apart on all sides during that time. HTN weekend was a fever dream because it was 
                    during Avery's birthday, and I got dinner with her on the Saturday, Sept. 16. Though 
                    it was extremely rough, it helped me get over her in the fact that she has become 
                    vindictive and a cold-blooded bitch since the breakup. Regardless, HTN weekend phased 
                    through me, but the ending was bittersweet with the cleanup, the dinner, and the 
                    goodbyes. It wasn't something I regret, but I wouldn't do it again. I appreciate 
                    the experience and what I took from it, but like I said, I'm not sure if it was 
                    worthwhile to me with how I was this year. Besides that, other mini things happened 
                    this term, such as the Lights Fest with Sam, roomie Rockton Fair day, Montreal with 
                    Vedan and Josh for her bday, Halloweekend, Art TO, Josh's dad & the funeral, and the 
                    NYE daytrip to Niagara-on-the-Lake (though that might happen after the new year).</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>In retrospect, it was a very volatile relationship, and it pains me to have the 
                    dissonance of the person I loved and who she became. I talked about a lot above, 
                    alongside the writings I have post-breakup, and we tried our best.</h1>

                <h1>The first breakup happened Jan. 17, and Sam pulled thru to help me finish my KP app. 
                    We then got back together and tried to work on things like scheduling events on gcal more
                     (weekly check-ups, things to do, etc.) since Avery is very schedule oriented and 
                     needs to plan ahead of time + from her end, being able to do more spontaneous things 
                     (and though she didn't really, she tried her best).</h1>

                <h1>We broke up again on June 17, and it was a somber time for me. She was already going 
                    on dates and talking to guys (foreshadowing is crazy here, I should've seen the red flag 
                    coming). 2 weeks later, we went to the Odd Duck on July 1 (to return each other's things)
                    and it ended up turning into talking about us again. At this point, things were very shaky 
                    at best. We were trying, but were at each other's wits' end.</h1>

                <h1>The final breaking point was August 27: talk #1 when she was picking up stuff from my 
                    place -> talk #2 over ft -> talk #3 at Loloan during HTN weekend for her bday. She 
                    became a version of herself that was cold, and villianized me for everything I did. 
                    Blamed majority (if not all things) onto me, and allowed me to be at my lowest while 
                    rubbing in my face how she's going on dates and talking to guys. A hypocrite, and she 
                    continued to be vindictive after the fact just to spite me. I go into more depth in my 
                    other writings about this, but at the end of the day, the love was always there.
                    Now, I'm glad we ended, but I'd hope that our paths can cross again some day in 
                    the future. Her heart was in the right place, and I just hope she's able to learn and 
                    grow to become someone she's proud to be.</h1>

                <h1>Since, I've been “working on myself” (aka. seeping in 'woe is me' and going on 
                    meaningless dates to subconsciously get back at Avery for being petty towards me), 
                    I'm trying to find inner peace (by getting off the apps + stop the random dating) 
                    and I'm slowly getting there at the point of me writing 
                    this letter. These random girls I talk to only make me feel worse when they either 
                    reject me, and/or when I ultimately don't feel ready or committed to trying again 
                    just yet. Why bother? I won't try to look, but will be open to anything.</h1>

                <h1>Moving in was exciting - committing to living with Sam, Vedan, and Josh was an 
                    absolute pain in the ass, but at the end of the day, I'm thankful that I did. 
                    I got out of the 4 grey walls that boxed me in, and the memories that stayed there. 
                    This new house is being filled with new, memorable events, and I'm excited for the 
                    final term.</h1>

                    me at my lowest. You're happy this year, and it's heartwarming to see who you've 
                    become now compared to when I first hung out with you. We did so much this year, 
                    and there's a lot more to come next year that I'm pumped for.</h1>

                    year until you returned to Waterloo this fall. Though there were quite a few 
                    highs and lows with living with you and being constantly exposed to your energy, you've been 
                    someone I can rely on for support through life and moving forward. We did a lot 
                    together this fall, and it's always been a wonderful time.</h1>

                    great since. I hope you're okay, with what happened in your family, and I know 
                    you're a strong guy. You're surrounded by people that love and care for you, and

                    fall (besides the random Berkeley FT Josh and I had w/ you). This term has been 
                    crazy, and you always brought the vibes. 10 beers at Pub that day and the end of 
                    term party at your apartment bonded us, and I'm gonna miss you. But this year, 
                    maybe we'll all see you for either St. Pattys, Grad, or a part of Grad trip? 
                    Maybe even for our reading week trip.</h1>

                    time it did this year, there's always something new and entertaining to talk 
                    about. From staying the night at your place right before my final breakup with 
                    Avery, to staying at your place for the 6lack concert (lol): you're always there 
                    for me and it's always insightful what you have to share with me. I'm excited 
                    for your exchange to Melbourne, and I know you'll do amazing things there that 
                    I can't wait to hear about when you're back.</h1>

                    me visiting you in Toronto after not seeing each other for so long. Our friendship 
                    remained strong since 1A, and I'm happy it did. We called in June to catchup when 
                    you were at Apple, and I was reading at the park (during the work day with Landa 
                    lol), and then this fall, we tried to badminton but that never happened - the plan 
                    changed into getting Booster Juice and me venting about the shitty year that unfolded. 
                    And then towards the end of the term, both you and Lukas noticed I was in disarray, 
                    and we got bbt and talked thru life and my mental state. You care, and I'm glad you do.</h1>

                <h1>After getting the Formlabs offer early, I managed to sweep past all the stress from 2B 
                    job hunting. It was everything I wanted and more - the company, culture, team, and work 
                    as all amazing. I got to work on a big project that I still talk about in interviews to 
                    this day, and I'm thankful that they gave me that opportunity. From there, I sent a fuck 
                    ton of cold emails. some of which was from WaterlooWorks. One stuck, and I got Level Home 
                    rather early on in the hunt in 3A - one 30 minute call and that was it?? Crazy.</h1>
                <h1>Moving forward, I started an early job hunt in end of August for a job this Summer 2023, 
                    and I got barely anything from hundreds of applications to this day (10/2/23). It's dry out 
                    here, but I managed Roblox, Palantir, and Majestik, all of which I bombed hardcore. At this point, 
                    I'm a little worried for my last coop, but I still have hope. Right now, I'm in the midst of 3 
                    companies - Meta, Dusty Robotics, and Wellspring. Though this may be a letter supposed to be about 
                    2022, the final job hunt is driving me insane, and it's bleeding into the new year for sure.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/trips</h3>
                <h1>My life in 2022 has been absolutely exhausting in positive and negative ways. The highs were high, 
                    and the lows were low. Starting off 2022, I flew to Boston for my internship at Formlabs, only to be 
                    scammed out $2k USD and homeless. It was a rough time trying to find a place to stay while also 
                    balancing my mental state. Besides that whole thing, Boston was a crazy time; meeting Josh, Vedan, 
                    and Imaad, getting COVID, exploring the city and more, my first NBA game, parties, travelling to Newport, 
                    mom visiting Boston, Avery visiting Boston soon after, going to NYC to visit Sam and then coming back to 
                    Boston, the St. Patty's Day parade, MIT tour day, the observatory, and ending it on renting a yacht and 
                    soon after coming to NYC to visit Sam and the twins, then coming back to Boston with them. There is 
                    probably so much that I'm missing here, but that's okay, I lived life, and that's what matters.</h1>
                <h1>Coming back to Waterloo was an interesting time, and a tough term for sure. It wasn't exactly the 
                    most eventful, but Avery's apartment did get roaches, so she basically moved into my place. There was 
                    also the beach thing for my birthday, which was honestly very nice of everyone to do with me, but it was 
                    whelming unfortunately haha. Onwards to the ending of the term, Sam and I trekked a long way to Toronto 
                    during the Rogers outage only to have the Weeknd concert postponed. It was such a tragic time, but life 
                    just gets in the way and there's only so much you can do. At least there was Anders, which was a good time 
                    with Andrew and all. There was also Anime North, which was a good time - bought some cool stuff, and had a 
                    good experience overall.</h1>
                <h1>From there was the family trip to Alaska with an initial stop at Vancouver and Kelowna. We should've flown
                    straight to Kelowna first lol. But the hiking was beautiful (the Stawamus Chief hike though was the most 
                    brutal thing I've experience in a while), and the wine tasting was pretty dang good. The trips around 
                    Vancouver was also a great nostalgic time. I met up with Andy, and I had to call him out on being a terrible 
                    friend as of late, and we really haven't talked since. Besides that though, the Alaska cruise was gorgeous, 
                    and a once in a lifetime trip... but maybe later in life I'll come back. Soon after we got home was the trip 
                    to St. Catherines with Avery and that was lovely of her but I'm also tired as fuck at this point.</h1>
                <h1>From there was the last term of 2022 - California. So much happened here, good and bad, but I couldn't have 
                    done it without Vedan and Imaad. I met so many cool Apple interns and explored quite a bit, only to fly back 
                    to Toronto 3 weeks in because of the Weeknd concert being postponed until then. The concert was mind-blowing 
                    though, and I'd do that trip again with no hesitation - I would hope that it'd be better spaced out next time 
                    because I don't think anyone missed me enough yet. Back in the Bay area, I had the trip to Yosemite, which had 
                    a memorable first night due to me being too drunk. But after that, it was a fun and exciting time, where we took 
                    one of the hardest trails for some reason too late in the day. Coming back home was a bunch of parties and 
                    explorations and good food and lots of thrifting. There was a trip to Napa Valley for a wine tasting, and I 
                    was too poorly dressed for it!!! So embarrassing, but all good with Imaad's button-up. We were bousie bitches 
                    that day. This was also the same time that Sam made her way over to SF, and we explored and had a decent time, 
                    though it was definitely mid compared to NYC. Right after Sam left, was when Avery arrived, and we immediately 
                    went for a water lantern festival. Beautiful opener to her time in Cali, but not without its arguments. We 
                    travelled around, and I showed her some great spots, and then we flew over to LA for the first time each. The 
                    sights were beautiful, but also exhausting within itself. Some NBA games, some museums, some concerts, and 
                    some views. After Avery left, soon after was the Vegas trip, and it was everything I expected it to be. So 
                    many lights, so much alcohol and strippers, so much money. The group going was very fun, and we all lost a 
                    lil money except Michael, who earned $1200 USD. Insane!!! There was the Post Malone concert though, so still 
                    extremely worthwhile. Literally right after that though, Mom and Dad came to visit, and we ran back a similar 
                    itinerary from Avery's trip over. SF -> LA, with a mix of that long ass fight for a discounted rental Avis 
                    car. From there was just the Apple Christmas party, and ending my term at Level Home on a decent enough note. 
                    The end of the term ended on a melancholic goodbye, with me, Imaad, and Vedan saying goodbye for a little 
                    while. Flying back to Canada, I just missed the  the snowstorm that delayed so many flights, and the flooding 
                    in SF as well (which ultimately delayed my security deposit and I was pissed as fuck - I'm not gonna go into 
                    the whole Cindie situation here because I'd rather forget it than to say her name once more). Christmas with 
                    the family was a pleasant time, and New Year's with Avery, Josh and Sam's friends was a good time. It was 
                    great seeing Josh again, and I know that I'll see him again soon enough.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>Over a year has passed since dating Avery, and it's been a very hectic time being together. From going long 
                    distance right off the bat, to her basically living with me in the summer, to long distance yet again. 
                    It's been a journey with a lot of ups and downs. With September and January having almost making us break 
                    up, it's been hard for sure. But I know that I love this girl, and I want to work on it together.</h1>
                <h1>Avery met my parents soon after I came back in Waterloo during the summer term, and since then, my parents 
                    have come to like her quite a bit. I've met her family once, and somehow her whole extended family knows and 
                    likes me? Word spreads fast with huh. We've also done some trips together, such as exploring Boston, SF, and 
                    LA together, alongside smaller dates around the GTA and KW area.</h1>
                <h1>Moving forward with this relationship, I want to explore new things together, personally and externally. We 
                    can do this, together.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/etc</h3>
                <h1>Throughout the year, I've experienced so many new things - people, sights, things. It's been a year that I 
                    won't forget, for better or worse, and it makes me reminisce on the memories of what once was.</h1>
                <h1>New music was discovered, new playlists for each term. I started learning salsa in the summer term with Sam, 
                    and I continue that with Avery this winter term in January 2023. I continued with volleyball in summer and 
                    now, and I love being a setter. Maybe this year I'll get into boxing, who knows? Lately, I've also had this 
                    urge to explore new hobbies, such as embroidery, and past ones, like boxing. I was supposed to get my 
                    motorcycle license in the Bay are with Imaad, but maybe this year I'll get that done.</h1>
                <h1>Besides that, I've also tried therapy again during my time at Level. It wasn't anything particularly 
                    enlightening, and the time was short, but I feel like it was a good attempt to explore where my mind 
                    currently is at. Maybe with future opportunities, I can continue therapy at a more leisurely pace to 
                    work on myself.</h1>
                <h1>2022 was also the year I went to so many concerts - John Mayer, Anders, the Weeknd, the Chainsmokers, Alaina 
                    Castillo, Post Malone, SF Symphony - and they all vibrated their frequencies into my mind. I love it, and I 
                    just went to the Eden concert with Leon and his friend in Toronto the other day, and later this term, I'm 
                    gonna go to the Keshi concert with Avery. I'm thrilled to continue experiencing new things, and live music 
                    is a definite plus to my life.</h1>
                <h1>Museums in the east coast are incredible btw.</h1>


                <h2>List of close friends that I hold close to my heart this year</h2>
                <h1>People are becoming places, and I can't be everywhere at once.</h1>
                <h1>Sam: always been there for me (or for the most part, - you still suck at texting but you have been getting a 
                    little better and I'm proud). A few weeks ago in January you confided in how you want to be a better friend 
                    to me, and that you appreciate me, and I'm thankful. I can see how you've changed over the time that we've 
                    known each other, and I think it's amazing seeing you grow and work on yourself.</h1>
                <h1>Vedan: You were a new friend to me this year, and it was a very polarizing experience for the better. I'm 
                    sorry for not being as good as a friend back in Boston, but since Summerloo and SF, I feel like we've grown 
                    closer. This coming 4th year will be a crazy experience, living together, but it'll be fun. I hope that this 
                    winter/summer term doesn't push us apart too much.</h1>
                <h1>Josh: After seeing you again on New Year's, I'm hopeful that I'll be back in the Bay Area. If that happens, 
                    we can hangout again and have crazy times just like during Boston. If not, then maybe some trips will happen
                    during summer? At the least, there's that Europe trip where we'll visit Imaad and Vedan for the bull run. 
                    Besides, we'll be living together in 4th year too so you know it'll be great.</h1>
                <h1>Laura: Despite our limited times together the past year, I feel as though we are still close friends. I wish 
                    that there can be more opportunities for our paths to cross, but we're both busy with opposite schedules. 
                    Maybe in the future, when school settles down and life picks up for the both of us.</h1>
                <h1>Raewyn: I love our sassy friendship, it makes me feel as though you bring out the best of my funny side. I'm 
                    sad to see you drop a year, but I am proud and excited for what you'll do moving forward. SYDE isn't the same 
                    without you, and I hope we can reconnect again in summer.</h1>
                <h1>Imaad: Meeting in Boston, to Summerloo, to the Bay area; I feel as though despite the year together, there's 
                    still a slight wall between us. I'll work on it, and hopefully you will too. I appreciate our friendship, and 
                    I want us to be better friends moving forward. I'll see you in Spain this coming summer, and maybe that'll be 
                    the catalyst. I still remember our time at the Warriors game; we had a great chat together and I want to make 
                    sure that that memory doesn't lose itself.</h1>
                <h1>Note that Keaton and Andy aren't listed this time around - things have changed, and times are changed. After the 
                    whole Malak shit and Keaton blmaing me and Sam for not helping, I decided to take a step back from the friendship.
                    It wasn't healthy anymore, and I felt frustrated with who he's becoming. Even now, he's in a regressed state of who 
                    he once was, and it's sad to see. With Andy, after calling him out in Vancouver, we both haven't reached out to each 
                    other. Life's busy for the both of us, and I don't think each of us want to make the first move.</h1>


                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <h1>With 2023 already underway, there are a lot of things to look forward to with this year. It already started out 
                    better than 2022, that's for sure. I've learnt my lessons, and I'll ensure that I have proper living conditions 
                    with good roommates, I promise myself.</h1>
                <h1>Volunteering with Sam this term didn't pan out, but maybe for 4th year if I have time? I see the work you're 
                    putting out there to donate food and volunteer, and I respect the morality. I also have new hobbies that I want 
                    to continue exploring, and I know that the past 2 months in 2023 have been hectic as hell, but I hope that I can 
                    carve time to work on them. It's just that with the final co-op coming up, it's been a huge time suck and I'm 
                    wasting away at finding a job that I can enjoy and continue into full-time hopefully. We'll see where I land and 
                    where life takes me.</h1>
                <h1>The elective situation was not great at all, with the back and forth for Tech Art and my Cognitive Science minor. 
                    This term I'm taking Psych of Evil and Metaphysics & Epistemology, and I wish I had the mental space to enjoy it 
                    while it happens in front of me, but for now, I'll keep up with taking notes and maybe I can learn more about them 
                    later.</h1>
                <h1>NYC reading week never panned out, but I'm writing this as I'm about to head to Toronto with Sam for a 3 day mini 
                    trip. It wasn't what I anticipated, but it'll still be a fun time. There's also future trips to look forward to, 
                    such as the Vietnam trip at the end of the winter term, the summer co-op location with a mix of maybe Vegas/NYC/Seattle/etc, 
                    theres also the South Africa trip with Avery at the end of summer term, and then maybe at the end of the year we 
                    can do some cottage trips or another lil mini trip somewhere warm!</h1>
                <h1>It's nearing graduation, and just about a year from now, I'll be out of school. Maybe I'll do a Masters of Business, 
                    or that MIT Media Lab in the far future. I'm excited to see where life takes me, and I need to remember that 
                    nothing is permanent. Things will change, and with the bad comes the good, and vise versa. We'll see what happens, 
                    but just know that I'm learning as a person. I'm flawed, and that's a good thing.</h1>
                <h1 class="spacing-b">Though it's year of the Cat, next year is back to year of the Dragon, so next year will most definitely be my year.</h1>

                <h1>The snow is slowly melting outside as it steadily creeps closer to 2022, and I'm 
                    sitting at home wearing my red, oversized, arts sweater. The evening is dark and cold, 
                    with the hazy shadows of the night's sky casting a somber light indoors. It's December 30, 
                    2021, and it feels like I've been living this year with my eyes wide shut; how is it already 
                    the end of the year? </h1>
                <h1>So I write this to myself, a year from now, to take a look back on me at the start of this year 
                    to where I am right now.</h1>

                <h1>---</h1>

                <h1>Dear me of 2022,</h1>
                <h1>As 2021 leaves me, the bitter taste of retrograde remains in my mouth. Reflecting on 
                    everything that's occurred in my life this year, there's so much to say, yet the words 
                    escape me still. I'd like to think that I did everything right, and that my instincts 
                    brought me to a happier state of mind - but that is simply untrue. My interactions and 
                    experiences with myself and others were riddled with mistakes and misgivings, but that doesn't 
                    and shouldn't define me. It's how I rectify them and move forward.</h1>

                <h2>Things that happened, a recap</h2>
                <h3 class="override-top-m">Career/Design</h3>
                <h1>A lot of things happened this year, and what I'm about to list out are merely the ones I 
                    can currently remember, though there is probably much more that evade my train of thought. 
                    Starting the year off in terms of work and design, the project about Discover Together was 
                    finally wrapped up with the Aphrodite Project partnering up with us. </h1>
                <h1>As well, I applied to 300 jobs within the span of January to April - applications, LinkedIn 
                    messages, cold emails... there were the highs of hearing from Google and Twitch, and the lows 
                    of Pencil and Tulip bullshit. I was too egotistical, thinking that with Watsi and Synqrinus, 
                    I was ahead of the bunch. And to be far, I guess I was, but that did cause me to become conceited 
                    in what I wanted. I ended up doing interviews and design challenges for Lacework, Panasonic, and 
                    CDK Global during exam season at the end of April. Rejection, rejection, job, respectively. Finally 
                    got CDK Global at the end of April, and it started in June so I had 6 weeks to recover and regain 
                    my composure. </h1>
                <h1>That was the most burnt out I've been in ages, and that was a carried over continuation from the 
                    end of 2020 with my mental low of the breakup with Norah. Past that, I had high hopes for Loo Labs, 
                    but once Aman and Queenie left, Jeff decided to make uncanny decisions that left me out in the sun to 
                    dry. Him and Carolina fucked me over, and I do not plan on revisiting those memories here, but Olya 
                    and myself bonded over our mutual anger of the fallout there (which by the way, I should reach out 
                    to her again, it's been a while). </h1>
                <h1>But know that things did pick up after the fact, with Formlabs initially ghosting me in January, 
                    only to give me the job in May. I deferred the offer to January 2022, and that gave me so much peace 
                    of mind this fall term. There was no need for me to look for a job while everyone else was stressed 
                    with balancing 2B and interviews, but I'm thriving in that aspect. Boston will be a great change of 
                    pace for me mentally, and I'm excited to see what comes out of it. Only concerns right now are COVID 
                    to board my plane, and the high levels of infection there, but that's a later issue that hopefully 
                    will work itself out.</h1>
                <h1>Besides the coop hustle, I got the opportunity to volunteer at Watsi. It was an on and off thing, but 
                    was a good step towards what I can potentially see myself thriving to do in the future. Synqrinus also 
                    reached out with a little more work, but I finally cut the rope and they no longer are my freelancing 
                    connection. The money was great, but I'm happier with that load off my shoulders. As well, many 
                    other startups have been reaching out to me, asking me to join them as lead designers, and that 
                    excites me. Not because I can work with them, but because there is already a foundation for my name 
                    being known and my skills being wanted. My ego is happy, but there is still a long road ahead of me.</h1>
            
                <h3>Personal life/trips</h3>
                <h1>Sam, Raewyn, Chidi, and I were gonna go to Vancouver for the summer term to work remotely. But the flair 
                    of the Brazilian variant scared Raewyn, and she bailed. Understandable, but still uncanny when she still 
                    moves to Toronto anyways. We (well really I) dealt with an extremely unhappy landlord, and we lost $400 
                    each to the security deposit.</h1>
                <h1>So instead, I decided to go to Vancouver at the end of the summer term anyways because fuck COVID, I'm 
                    tryna at least live a lil and see Keaton and Andy. I visited two days before the end of the CDK term in 
                    Surrey with Keaton, then went over to Vancouver with Andy after a few days. The weather was beautiful, 
                    and I felt blessed. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>Besides that, Sam and I spontaneously decided to go to NYC during reading week. Absolutely no regrets; the 
                    trip was incredible, we did so much and drank practically every day. Met Zarwan, met Jaimie; ate good food, 
                    drank good drinks. The influence I've had on Sam has made her more spontaneous and social, and it's great 
                    seeing her be happy. Look at the map of my trip and the entry post here for the details on the trip. </h1>
                <h1>With those trips, the second half of the fall term, I've been a little more frugal with money. Had a talk 
                    with Sam, and we both agreed that it's not necessarily because we are broke, but because you can always earn 
                    back money, but you can't get back experiences. Truly no regrets.</h1>

                <h3>Personal life/dating</h3>
                <h1>The start of the year was with her living rent free in my head, and still to this day. It's draining, emotionally 
                    saddening, and sometimes I wish things could've worked out differently. But it happens the way it does, and I 
                    can't regret that. I've learnt a lot this year, where I've gotten to a more introspective state of mind. I noticed 
                    everyone puts too much emphasis in the words people say as the basis for their character from that person's 
                    perspective, rather than the smaller actions that portray them much better than the words of someone unaware 
                    or still learning about themselves. Read through the previous journal posts to see my growth, experiences, and 
                    thoughts.</h1>
                <h1>Besides all this, I've dated around. Notable ones were Sarah, where she progressively became more and more 
                    two-dimensional. It was a situationship/friends 
                    with benefits. Pity and loneliness was the motivator there, and I hope the best for her, just without me. I also met 
                    Jaimie in NYC, and we vibed well. We had a one night stand, but I realized how empty that makes me feel, and how 
                    I become more emotionally attached. I require the emotion to drive a relationship and sex, so that taught me 
                    something at least. Meeting and chatting with so many others, my friends and I realized that I pull, which is 
                    cool for my ego, but nothing ever panned out. I met Lucy, who ended up telling me I was soft and had no red flags, 
                    so she wasn't attracted. What the fuck is that about? I don't know. I was on the verge of just shutting it down and 
                    picking it up in Boston to at least make friends, but right before that, I met Avery. We just clicked, looking for 
                    the same thing at the same time. Right person, right time? It sure feels that way; things are still fresh, so we'll 
                    see how things go from here. Don't be hasty, me. Don't let my past mistakes repeat with Avery, please.</h1>
                
                <h3>Personal life/etc</h3>
                <h1>With everything above, there was much more that happened. Failed my G test once due to a stupid, minor thing, 
                    but finally passed the second time after worrying my license would expire before I come back from Boston. 
                    Same, Keaton, Olya, and I also worked on the Poster Project, and things were optimistic but eventually died 
                    out. Good concept, but lacked motivation and drive. I also had a loose screw in my jaw from the surgery, so 
                    I went through a rough time removing that. That also includes the infected ear at the end of fall term, and 
                    hives at the beginning of the year. So lots of medical fuckups to my body. Alongside all this, I finally decided 
                    to try out therapy. It wasn't too particularly helpful, but it 
                    helped consolidate my thoughts on certain things (check out my draft on the sessions). So much more that I 
                    probably forgot about, but this is the general jist.</h1>

                <h2>List of close friends that I hold close to heart this year</h2>
                <h1>Sam - we're as close as ever. Of course there was a few hiccups here and there, but it's notable that we both 
                    value our friendship together and don't want anything to get in the way of that. NYC was wonderful, we have 
                    very similar boundaries and thought processes, same standards with school. She opened up about how she's 
                    gonna be pretty sad while I'm gone, but I trust that she'll be alright and that she'll be in good company 
                    with Keaton and the twins. </h1>
                <h1>Keaton - after seeing him again since end of 2019 in Surrey, he's a close friend of mine. Still slightly naive 
                    and young, but he'll grow. Sam and I talked about this and how I leave a strong influence on people, and I 
                    suppose that's true. He values what me and Sam think, though probably not academically (lol). That's okay, 
                    I'm excited to see how he'll prosper, but first, he needs to be less cringe and more open minded.</h1>
                <h1>Andy - it's like time never really passed. Seeing him again in Van, we were bros just like before he left. 
                    He's in his prime, with a great environment to thrive, and I hope he learns to be more warm. He may be empathetic, 
                    but he still has ways to go when it comes to being less self-centred. We facetime often to update each other on 
                    life, but it does sometimes feel like he isn't too interested in what I have to say with my life. Jordan is giving 
                    him perspective on the tech industry, which is amazing, but I worry what he's causing to Andy's mental state 
                    after the cheating incident. </h1>
                <h1>Laura - same old, same old. We don't talk constantly, but we do love to catch up every so often, and that 
                    is what works for us. She's adjusting to Ryerson, but I believe in her. Manifesting good energy for her, 
                    she'll do just fine. We've always had the same thoughts for some things, but I really appreciate her perspective 
                    when it comes to some of my problems and things I do. It's really grounding, what she does for me.</h1>
                <h1>Raewyn - crazy ass mofo, and I fucking love that for her. Middle of 2B, we said fuck school, let's have a 5 
                    hour discussion on life and our personal lives. We found out that despite having such different upbringings, 
                    we have such a scarily similar thought process and opinion on life, people, and other things. At the end of 
                    the term, she told me that she's her most truest and most comfortable version of herself with me, and I 
                    really treasured that. You're a really lit ass fucker, and I value our friendship. #homies4life, but seriously 
                    tho, where the podcast at?</h1>
                
                <h2>Reflections on this year and my learnings on self, life, and moving forward</h2>
                <h1>The first thing I want to tell you is that time doesn't fully heal wounds. At least, not for me. I feel 
                    that I am forever in motion with the past, and Laura always tells me that same thing. That I'm too hung up 
                    on things that already passed. I am forced by my program to constantly think about the future, and I'm 
                    trying to live in the moment when I can, but I psychologically get too caught up in the past. </h1>
                <h1 class="spacing-b">But that's okay. 2021 me is working through things, and I hope the me that's reading this a year from now 
                    is thriving. Currently in love w/ philosophy, psychology, cinematography, drawing, blogging, poetry, 
                    volleyball, board games, music production, sneakers, and so much more. I made 4 new playlists each month that describes 
                    my moods during that time. I wrote numerous journal posts that explore a more vulnerable and introspective version of myself - 
                    meant for myself but left public for anyone that cares to read it. Boston -> Waterloo -> where next 
                    for my 5th coop (hopefully NYC, SF, or Norway). There are trips lined up for next year, where the end of 
                    Formlabs is when Sam and (hopefully twins + others) come visit me in Boston/NYC for a lit ass time before 
                    in-person 3A rips us a new one. Middle/end of August, family wants to go on a cruise in Alaska, and staying 
                    in Vancouver for a few days afterwards. Who knows where else I'll be in 2022, but I hope you know that every 
                    little thing will be okay, Lam. Things always work out, one way or another. </h1>

                <h4>New beginnings</h4>

                <h1>Begin each year with the end in mind. That's what I'm telling myself right now, and I hope that a year 
                    today will be exactly how I hope it to be. </h1>
                <h1>But let's recap 2020. Moved out and lived in Toronto with Laura, Andrew, and Anna. Had a great time 
                    working at BlueCat and ending the shift hanging out with Sam, or heading to a restaurant with Rae,
                    or going to the gym and cooking. I learned HTML/CSS and coded my website, which got me great positions.
                    I was feeling great, being social and productive, living life. I still rode that vibe going into the 
                    pandemic, which was when I met Norah. 6 months; 1 month of falling in love, 5 months of being in love, 
                    and the end of 2020 with sadness and heartbreak. Breakups are much easier to deal with when you're not 
                    couped up at home 24/7. My saving grace was Sam, Keaton, Laura, Andy. Through the depression and mental 
                    booms caused by 1B and Norah, I need to grow as a person still. Don't we all?</h1>
                <h1>Though Norah did take up most of my year, I learned how to deepen my friendships and slowly learn to love 
                    myself. I had the cheating scandal with 112, and that was horrible but that's now past me. Had the surgery, 
                    and though it wasn't exactly how I envisioned it to be, it's over now and I can move forward. Worked on 
                    Communifund, a side project about deepening community bonds. Let's list out what I did:</h1>
                <h1>· UWPM</h1>
                <h1>· Enlight</h1>
                <h1>· Loo Labs</h1>
                <h1>· Synqrinus</h1>
                <h1>· Drawings</h1>
                <h1>· BlueCat</h1>
                <h1>· Ceridian</h1>
                <h1>· Discover Together</h1>
                <h1>· rethink</h1>
                <h1>· podcast</h1>
                <h1>· Communifund</h1>
                <h1>· Missing Persons *</h1>
                <h1>· Old/New Portfolio</h1>
                <h1>· Norah's website</h1>
                <h1>· new ideas!</h1>
                <h1>-> and much more that I don't remember. This is when I was at my lowest and super unmotivated, so imagine 
                    what'll happen when I'm at my highest.</h1>

                <h1>Started 2020 in Niagara Falls with Andy and Jacob, this time I'm gonna start with Laura and Debbie. 2021's 
                    gonna be hype - podcast launch, new portfolio, new coop, summer in Vancouver/Montreal/? with Rae, DT x 
                    Aphrodite and maybe Bumble + others, maybe even befriending Norah again or/and finding new love.</h1>

                <h1 class="spacing-b">This year's for me. Losing sight of what's important means my eyes are open. This is my time, 2021.</h1>
